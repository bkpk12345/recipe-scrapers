            "Egg cartons are marked with both a sell-by date and a pack date. The pack date\n\t\t\t\tis the day the eggs were graded and packed, which is generally a week within being laid but, legally,\n\t\t\t\tmay be within as much as 30 days. The pack date is printed on egg cartons as a three-digit code just\n\t\t\t\tbelow the sell-by date, and it runs consecutively from 001 (January 1) to 365 (December 31).",
            "The sell-by date, which is the legal limit set by the USDA, is within 30 days of the\n\t\t\t\tpack date. In short, a carton of eggs may be up to two months old by the end of the sell-by date. Even\n\t\t\t\tso, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), eggs are still fit for consumption for an\n\t\t\t\tadditional three to five weeks past the sell-by date.",
            "In the test kitchen, we tasted two-and three-month-old eggs and found them perfectly\n\t\t\t\tpalatable. At four months, the white was very loose and the yolk tasted faintly of the refrigerator,\n\t\t\t\tthough it was still edible. Our advice is to use your discretion. If the eggs smell odd or display\n\t\t\t\tdiscoloration, pitch them. Older eggs also lack the structure-lending properties of fresh eggs, so\n\t\t\t\tbeware when baking."

            "Several companies are marketing eggs with a high level of omega-3 fatty acids,\n\t\t\t\tthe healthful unsaturated fats also found in some fish. We set up a blind tasting of eggs containing\n\t\t\t\tvarious levels of omega-3. Our finding: More omega-3s translates into a richer egg flavor and a deeper\n\t\t\t\tyolk color. Why? Commercially raised chickens usually peck on corn and soy, while chickens on an\n\t\t\t\tomega-3-enriched diet have supplements of greens, flaxseeds, and algae, which also add flavor,\n\t\t\t\tcomplexity, and color. When shopping for a good egg, buyer beware: Brands may claim a high level of\n\t\t\t\tomega-3s, but the fine print sometimes reveals that the number refers to the level present in two eggs,\n\t\t\t\tnot one. Look for brands that guarantee at least 200 milligrams per egg."

            "Chances are good that you’re tossing egg yolks down the drain when making\n\t\t\t\trecipes that call for egg whites only. A better option might be liquid egg whites. We tested three\n\t\t\t\tbrands of liquid egg whites alongside hand-separated whites in our recipes for egg white omelets,\n\t\t\t\tmeringue cookies, and angel food cake. They all made acceptable substitutes in omelets; in baked goods,\n\t\t\t\thowever, they came up a bit short—literally. The USDA requires that liquid egg whites be\n\t\t\t\tpasteurized, and this process compromises the whites’ structure. As a result they can’t achieve the same\n\t\t\t\tvolume when whipped as fresh whites. Our top-ranked Eggology 100% Egg Whites are a good substitute for\n\t\t\t\tfresh whites in omelets, scrambles, and frittatas, and they make satisfactory baked goods."

Most of the Pecorino that is exported has been aged. Like Parmesan, it is\n\t\t\t\tbest for grating, but Pecorino has a much saltier flavor."

            "Originally crafted from the whey by-product that forms during the making of Pecorino\n\t\t\t\tRomano cheese, ricotta cheese has garnered fame on its own as a white, cushiony filling for baked pasta\n\t\t\t\tdishes. As ricotta has gained global popularity, however, preservation methods used by many large-scale\n\t\t\t\tmanufacturers have turned these once fluffy, buttery, sweet curds into chalky, sour spreads. We are not\n\t\t\t\tbig fans of most supermarket ricottas, as they are packed with gums and other stabilizers to guarantee a\n\t\t\t\tshelf life of weeks. Our favorite brand is Calabro, whose curds are fresh drawn from nothing other than\n\t\t\t\tVermont farm whole milk, skim milk, a starter, and a sprinkle of salt. Granted, its shelf life spans\n\t\t\t\tonly a matter of days, but one spoonful should be enough to guarantee its quick disappearance from your\n\t\t\t\tfridge. If you can’t find this particular brand, check labels and look for another fresh ricotta without\n\t\t\t\tgums or preservatives. We prefer whole-milk ricotta but part-skim ricotta is fine. Do not try to use\n\t\t\t\tnonfat ricotta, as it is very dry and flavorless."

            "Shopping by cut: Ground chuck generally has quite a lot of fat, which translates to\n\t\t\t\trich flavor and tender texture—it’s the best choice for burgers. Ground sirloin has good flavor\n\t\t\t\tbut is a bit less tender (because it’s leaner). Ground sirloin is great in meatloaf and Bolognese sauce\n\t\t\t\tbut can be a bit dry in burgers. Ground round is often gristly and lacking in beef flavor; we don’t\n\t\t\t\trecommend it.",
            "Shopping by fat: For burgers, we recommend buying beef labeled 80 percent lean (or 85\n\t\t\t\tpercent lean). Ideally, the label will indicate that the meat is from the chuck, but round can have a\n\t\t\t\tsimilar content. For recipes with additional sources of fat and moisture (such as meatloaf), 85 percent\n\t\t\t\tlean or even 90 percent lean ground beef is best. Ground sirloin usually is 90 percent to 93 percent\n\t\t\t\tlean and is a good choice here."

            "As for salt, you can season the meat right before cooking for flavor, but you can also\n\t\t\t\tuse salt (and time) in advance of cooking to improve the texture of many cuts. There are two ways to do\n\t\t\t\tthis: salting or brining. Salting is more convenient (no need to cram a large container of salt water in\n\t\t\t\tthe fridge), and it won’t thwart the goal of crispy skin on poultry or a well-browned crust on steak,\n\t\t\t\tchops, and roasts since no moisture is added to their exteriors. However, salting is a slow process and\n\t\t\t\ttakes more time than brining.",
            "When salt is applied to raw meat, juices inside the meat are drawn to the surface. The\n\t\t\t\tsalt then dissolves in the exuded liquid, forming a brine that is eventually reabsorbed by the meat. The\n\t\t\t\tsalt changes the structure of the muscle proteins, allowing them to hold on to more of their own natural\n\t\t\t\tjuices. Salting is the best choice for meats that are already relatively juicy and/or well marbled.",
            "We prefer to use kosher salt for salting because it’s easier to distribute the salt\n\t\t\t\tevenly. The chart lists the meat items that we typically salt, along with notes on timing and method. If\n\t\t\t\tusing Morton Kosher Salt, reduce the amounts listed by 33 percent. See page 288 for details on salting\n\t\t\t\tpoultry.",
            "Brining works pretty much the same way as salting. Salt in the brine seasons the meat\n\t\t\t\tand promotes a change in its protein structure, reducing its overall toughness and creating gaps that\n\t\t\t\tfill up with water and keep the meat juicy and flavorful. Brining works faster than salting and can also\n\t\t\t\tresult in juicier lean cuts—such as pork tenderloin—since it adds, versus merely retains,\n\t\t\t\tmoisture. Note that brining inhibits browning, and it requires fitting a brining container in fridge.",

This happens through a process called the Maillard reaction, named after the French chemist who\n\t\t\t\tfirst described it in the early 1900s. The Maillard reaction occurs when the amino acids and sugars in\n\t\t\t\tthe food are subjected to heat, which causes them to combine. In turn, hundreds of different flavor\n\t\t\t\tcompounds are created. These compounds break down to form yet more new flavor compounds, and so on, and\n\t\t\t\tso on. It’s kind of like rabbits multiplying.",
            "When browning meat, you want a deep brown sear and a discernibly thick crust on all\n\t\t\t\tsides—best obtained by quick cooking over high heat. To ensure that meat browns properly, first\n\t\t\t\tmake sure the meat is dry before it goes into the pan; pat it thoroughly with paper towels. This is\n\t\t\t\tespecially important with previously frozen meat, which often releases a great deal of water. Second,\n\t\t\t\tmake sure the pan is hot by preheating it over high heat until fat added to the pan is shimmering or\n\t\t\t\talmost smoking. Finally, make sure not to overcrowd the pan; there should be at least ¼\n\t\t\t\tinch of space between the pieces of meat. If there isn’t, the meat is likely to steam instead of brown.\n\t\t\t\tIf need be, cook the meat in two or three batches."

            "A final but very important step when cooking all red meat and pork (as well as\n\t\t\t\tpoultry) is a resting period after the meat comes off the heat. As the proteins heat up during cooking\n\t\t\t\tthey coagulate, which basically means they uncoil and then reconnect in a different configuration. When\n\t\t\t\tthe proteins coagulate, they squeeze out part of the liquid that was trapped in their coiled structures\n\t\t\t\tand in the spaces between the individual molecules. The heat from the cooking source drives these freed\n\t\t\t\tliquids toward the center of the meat.",
            "This process of coagulation explains why experienced chefs can determine the doneness\n\t\t\t\tof a piece of meat by pushing on it and judging the amount of resistance; the firmer the meat, the more\n\t\t\t\tdone it is. But the coagulation process is apparently at least partly reversible, so as you allow the\n\t\t\t\tmeat to rest and return to a lower temperature after cooking, some of the liquid is reabsorbed by the\n\t\t\t\tprotein molecules as their capacity to hold moisture increases. As a result, if given a chance to rest,\n\t\t\t\tthe meat will lose less juice when you cut into it, which in turn makes for much juicier and more tender\n\t\t\t\tmeat.",
            "A thin steak or chop should rest for 5 to 10 minutes, while a thicker roast requires 15\n\t\t\t\tto 20 minutes. When cooking a huge turkey, the bird should rest for 30 minutes before it is carved. To\n\t\t\t\tkeep meat warm while it rests, tent it loosely with foil.

            "Most supermarkets regularly offer two slightly different styles of whole\n\t\t\t\tbone-in turkey breast: regular (aka true cut) and hotel (aka country-style). Regular-cut turkey breast\n\t\t\t\tincludes the whole bone-in breast with ribs, a portion of the wing meat, and a portion of the back and\n\t\t\t\tneck skin. The hotel-cut turkey breast is essentially the same cut, though it comes with its wings,\n\t\t\t\tneck, and giblets, all important material if you intend to make a gravy or sauce to accompany the cooked\n\t\t\t\tmeat. These tend to cost a little more and are almost always sold fresh, not frozen.",
            "Whichever style you find and purchase, try to avoid turkey breasts that have been\n\t\t\t\tinjected with a saline solution (a brine of sorts)—these are often called “self-basters.” We found\n\t\t\t\tthe solution masks the natural flavor of the turkey. (If the only bird you can find is a self-baster, do\n\t\t\t\tnot brine it, as the meat will already be quite salty.) Also, ignore the pop-up timer that comes with\n\t\t\t\tsome turkey breasts; the meat will be long overcooked before the popper pops. If your turkey has a\n\t\t\t\tpop-up timer, leave it in and gauge doneness according to an instant-read thermometer. Don’t remove the\n\t\t\t\ttimer until the meat is done; otherwise it will leave a gaping hole from which juices will flow."

So either make sure the skin is crispy or remove it. The key to crisp skin is\n\t\t\t\trendering all the fat that is between the skin and the meat. When cooking skin-on chicken pieces, we\n\t\t\t\ttypically will brown the skin in a hot skillet, then finish cooking the chicken over a lower temperature\n\t\t\t\tor in the even heat of the oven (this has the added benefit of creating flavorful browned\n\t\t\t\tbits—fond—in the skillet, great for making a pan sauce). When roasting a whole bird, if you\n\t\t\t\tdon’t want to serve the skin you can still keep it on while roasting to protect the delicate breast meat\n\t\t\t\tfrom the heat, but discard it before serving. For stews and braises, if you don’t crisp the skin and\n\t\t\t\trender the fat, you should typically discard the skin before cooking.

We tested the method on white fish (including cod and haddock) as well as on fattier salmon and\n\t\t\t\tsaw a dramatic improvement in both.

            "Barbecuing takes even longer than grill roasting—it’s not unusual for cooking\n\t\t\t\ttimes to exceed 3 hours—because the beef, pork, or poultry is cooked until proteins break down to\n\t\t\t\ta meltingly tender texture. This type of cooking requires low, gentle heat. As with grill roasting, food\n\t\t\t\tis not cooked directly over the coals or the lit burner. Barbecued foods derive their “barbecued” flavor\n\t\t\t\tfrom wood chips or chunks. The wood generates a deep, intense smoke that permeates the food.",
            "To make indoor cooking method analogies, grilling is like sautéing on the stovetop in a\n\t\t\t\thot skillet, and grill roasting is like roasting in the oven—both cook foods until just done and\n\t\t\t\tno further. Barbecuing is like braising—food is cooked past the point of what’s considered\n\t\t\t\twell-done, until the collagen breaks down and the meat is fork-tender. The table below summarizes the\n\t\t\t\tdifferences between the three cooking methods.",

We have found that by letting soup cool to\n\t\t\t\t85 degrees on the counter (which takes only an hour) before transferring it to the fridge, we can bring\n\t\t\t\tit down to 40 degrees in a total time of 4 hours and 30 minutes (well within the FDA’s recommended\n\t\t\t\trange).",

If you know you’re going to have leftovers, reserve them before you add the\n\t\t\t\tnoodles or other starchy element. Most soups can also be frozen for up to a month. There are two\n\t\t\t\texceptions to this rule. Noodles and dumplings will become very mushy, so soups with these ingredients\n\t\t\t\tare not the best candidates for freezing. Also, cream can curdle when frozen, so soups with a lot of\n\t\t\t\tdairy are best refrigerated for up to two days instead of being frozen.",

The other option is to pour the stock into a coffee mug lined with a 1-quart\n\t\t\t\tzipper-lock bag (the mug keeps the bag open as you pour). Place the sealed bags in a shallow baking dish\n\t\t\t\tand freeze. Once the stock is frozen solid, the bags can be removed from the pan and stored flat in the\n\t\t\t\tfreezer."

The other option is to insert a skewer or toothpick into the center\n\t\t\t\tof the item; it should emerge fairly clean, with perhaps just a few crumbs attached. If you see moist\n\t\t\t\tbatter, the item needs to bake longer. This test works well with muffins and loaf breads."

Sounds good, but in our tests we found that it makes no\n\t\t\t\tdifference whether you fill the empty cups with water. Go ahead and fill six cups, leaving the others\n\t\t\t\tempty.

        "description": [
            "There are two ways to judge doneness in quick breads. Fully baked items should\n\t\t\t\tfeel springy and resilient when the center is gently pressed. If your finger leaves an\n\t\t\t\timpression—or if the center jiggles—the item is not done. This works best with biscuits,\n\t\t\t\tscones, and loaf-style quick breads. The other option is to insert a skewer or toothpick into the center\n\t\t\t\tof the item; it should emerge fairly clean, with perhaps just a few crumbs attached. If you see moist\n\t\t\t\tbatter, the item needs to bake longer. This test works well with muffins and loaf breads."

            "It’s commonly taught that if you are making a half batch of muffins or cupcakes\n\t\t\t\tand thus don’t fill all the cups in the pan with batter, you should fill the empty cups with water.\n\t\t\t\tProponents of this practice contend that filling empty cups with water serves two functions: preventing\n\t\t\t\tthe pan from warping, and acting as a “heat sink” to ensure that muffins next to empty cups heat evenly\n\t\t\t\t(avoiding stunted growth or spotty browning). Sounds good, but in our tests we found that it makes no\n\t\t\t\tdifference whether you fill the empty cups with water. Go ahead and fill six cups, leaving the others\n\t\t\t\tempty. The muffins will turn out just fine."

The other option is to insert a skewer or toothpick into the center\n\t\t\t\tof the item; it should emerge fairly clean, with perhaps just a few crumbs attached. If you see moist\n\t\t\t\tbatter, the item needs to bake longer. This test works well with muffins and loaf breads."

The ethylene gas released\n\t\t\t\tby the ripe fruit triggers the release of ethylene in the unripe fruit, causing it to soften, ripen, and\n\t\t\t\tbecome sweeter."

            "This sounds obvious, but when it comes to fresh fruit, buying at the height of\n\t\t\t\tits growing season will make a huge difference in the quality of your fruit dessert. Sure, you can buy\n\t\t\t\tblueberries or raspberries year-round, but they are not nearly as good as those you will find in your\n\t\t\t\tmarket in the summer months. The rock-hard peaches you can find in the supermarket in April will likely\n\t\t\t\tbe mealy and may or may not ripen after you bring them home; they are absolutely no match for the fresh\n\t\t\t\tand fragrant summer peaches you can buy in July. If you want to make a peach cobbler before peach\n\t\t\t\tseason, it is probably better to use a recipe designed to work with frozen peaches. Stick to locally\n\t\t\t\tgrown varieties or wait for in-season fruit shipped in from other parts of the country."

            "A free-form tart generally starts with dough that is very similar to pie dough.\n\t\t\t\tIt must be easy to roll out and should be pliable enough to fold over the filling without tearing. For\n\t\t\t\tour Free-Form Tart Dough (page 750), we use nothing more than flour, butter, salt, and ice water. While\n\t\t\t\tpie dough contains a mix of shortening and butter, the dough in a free-form tart is so front and center\n\t\t\t\tthat we think it’s worth sacrificing some flakiness for better flavor. Pie dough also contains sugar.\n\t\t\t\tSince we like to sprinkle the tart with sugar before it goes into the oven, we don’t add any to the\n\t\t\t\tdough itself.",
            "Free-form tarts are almost always filled with fresh fruit. Because the fruit is exposed\n\t\t\t\tto direct oven heat, there’s usually no need to thicken the fruit—excess juices will simply\n\t\t\t\tevaporate. The most important thing to remember when making any free-form tart is to pile the filling in\n\t\t\t\tthe center of the dough, leaving a wide area around the perimeter free of any fruit. This allows the\n\t\t\t\tbaker to fold the dough over part of the filling and gives the tart its shape and structure."

            "A classic French-style tart is made with a dough that is richer and sweeter\n\t\t\t\tthan pie dough. While pie dough (and free-form tart dough) is tender and flaky, a classic tart crust\n\t\t\t\tshould be fine textured, buttery-rich, crisp, and crumbly. The dough is often referred to as “short” and\n\t\t\t\thas a texture similar to shortbread. Our Classic Tart Dough (page 751) relies on butter as well as an\n\t\t\t\tegg yolk and heavy cream to create a flavorful, rich crust. We find that confectioners’ sugar, rather\n\t\t\t\tthan granulated sugar, helps create the right sandy but crisp texture.",
            "A classic tart shell is always prebaked before filling. (Skip this step and the crust\n\t\t\t\twill be soggy, not crisp.) If the filling is already cooked (as with pastry cream), the tart shell\n\t\t\t\tshould be blind-baked with pie weights until the dough has set, then the weights are removed and the\n\t\t\t\tshell is baked further until crisp and golden brown. If the filling requires significant oven time, the\n\t\t\t\tpartially baked tart shell is removed from the oven so that the pie weights can be removed and the\n\t\t\t\tfilling added, and then the whole tart is returned to the oven to finish."

            "Many puddings and custards are prepared as individual portions and require\n\t\t\t\tramekins of different sizes, ranging from 4 to 6 ounces. For an all-purpose set, look for ramekins with\n\t\t\t\ta capacity of 6 ounces and a diameter of 3 inches, though for some of the recipes in this chapter you\n\t\t\t\twill want smaller ramekins. Also, it is best to look for ramekins made of high-fired porcelain (chip\n\t\t\t\tresistant) and those that are safe for use in the oven, broiler, microwave, and dishwasher. Small,\n\t\t\t\tshallow, fluted ramekins are the best choice when making crème brûlée (because they provide more surface\n\t\t\t\tarea for the caramelized topping), though you can also use round ramekins. Note that these ramekins come\n\t\t\t\tin various sizes. If you use the larger, 6-to 9-ounce ramekins, you will not be able to fit eight of\n\t\t\t\tthem in a roasting pan (see below) at one time and will instead have to cook your custards in batches."

Both work well, but the canister-style models take\n\t\t\t\tlonger to make denser (as opposed to airy) ice cream. Self-refrigerating models, on the other hand,\n\t\t\t\timmediately produce firmer, ready-to-serve frozen treats.",
            "Vanilla, in either bean or extract form, is used in numerous custards, puddings, and\n\t\t\t\tfrozen desserts. For recipes such as crème brûlée, where the flavor of vanilla is key, we opt to use\n\t\t\t\tbeans, as they provide a fuller aroma and more complex flavor than extract. Using both the pod and its\n\t\t\t\tseeds is key to maximizing the vanilla flavor; typically we steep the pod (along with the seeds) in warm\n\t\t\t\tdairy, then remove it before continuing with the recipe. Be sure to use fresh, plump pods for the best\n\t\t\t\tresults. The beans should be moist and have a bit of sheen to them; avoid those that look like dried,\n\t\t\t\tshriveled twigs.",
            "Extract is available in two styles: pure (natural) and imitation. Both are flavored\n\t\t\t\twith the compound vanillin, but natural vanillin is derived from vanilla beans whereas imitation\n\t\t\t\tvanillin is chemically extracted from wood pulp or cloves. For baked goods, like muffins and cakes, it’s\n\t\t\t\tactually hard to tell a difference between real and imitation, but for custards you should use only pure\n\t\t\t\tvanilla extract. Vanilla extract will last indefinitely as long as you store it in a sealed container\n\t\t\t\taway from heat and light."
