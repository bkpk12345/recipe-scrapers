        "title": "Perfect French Omelets",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: In contrast to half-moon,\n\t\t\t\tdiner-style omelets stuffed to the seams, the French omelet is a pristine rolled affair. The temperature\n\t\t\t\tof the skillet must be just right, the eggs beaten just so, and hand movements must be as swift as the\n\t\t\t\tability to gauge the exact second the omelet is done. Even a few extra seconds can spell disaster. A\n\t\t\t\tFrench omelet should boast an ultracreamy texture, rolled over minimal filling. We replaced the classic\n\t\t\t\tomelet skillet and fork with a simple nonstick skillet and wooden chopsticks. We preheated the skillet\n\t\t\t\tslowly over low heat to eliminate hot spots. Exact timing gives the omelet its creaminess, but we wanted\n\t\t\t\tto cheat with creamy ingredients; cold butter worked perfectly. Beating the eggs correctly is the key to\n\t\t\t\tlightness so we found the perfect number of strokes. We needed at least medium-high heat to puff up the\n\t\t\t\teggs with steam, but the omelet cooked too quickly to judge when it was done. We turned off the heat\n\t\t\t\twhen the eggs were still runny, letting residual heat do the rest of the cooking, giving us a flawless,\n\t\t\t\tcreamy French omelet.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: More challenging to cook properly\n\t\t\t\tthan a classic frittata, a thick frittata loaded with meat and vegetables often ends up dry,\n\t\t\t\toverstuffed, and overcooked. We wanted a frittata big enough to make a substantial meal for six to eight\n\t\t\t\tpeople. For the cheese, Gruyère, cheddar, goat cheese, and fontina worked well. We found that vegetables\n\t\t\t\tand meats must be cut into small pieces and precooked to drive off excess moisture and fat. A little\n\t\t\t\thalf-and-half added a touch of creaminess. Given the large number of eggs, we started the eggs on medium\n\t\t\t\theat and stirred them so they could cook quickly yet evenly. Then we slid the skillet under the broiler\n\t\t\t\tuntil the top had puffed and browned, removing it just before the frittata was cooked through, allowing\n\t\t\t\tthe residual heat to finish cooking the center.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Our ideal quiche should have a\n\t\t\t\ttender, buttery pastry case embracing a velvety smooth custard that is neither too rich nor too lean. We\n\t\t\t\ttested numerous combinations of dairy and eggs to find the perfect combination. The baking temperature\n\t\t\t\twas equally important; 350 degrees was low enough to set the custard gently and hot enough to brown the\n\t\t\t\ttop before the filling became dried out and rubbery. To keep the crust from becoming soggy, we parbaked\n\t\t\t\tit before adding the filling. To avoid spilling the custard, we set the parbaked crust on the baking\n\t\t\t\tsheet and poured the custard directly into the pastry shell. For perfectly baked quiche every time, we\n\t\t\t\tpulled it out of the oven when it was still slightly soft and allowed it to set up as it cooled.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: A classic cheese soufflé begins\n\t\t\t\twith a béchamel sauce (flour and butter cooked to form a roux and then thinned out with milk). We\n\t\t\t\tstarted by sautéing a shallot in the butter to add flavor. Once the béchamel was finished, we stirred in\n\t\t\t\ta generous amount of Gruyère along with a little dry mustard, nutmeg, salt, and pepper to boost the\n\t\t\t\tflavor of the cheese. We then added the egg yolks to this base before whipping the whites (with a little\n\t\t\t\tcream of tartar for stability) and folding them in last. For an extra shot of cheese, sprinkle the\n\t\t\t\tgreased soufflé dish as well as the top of the soufflé with a little grated Parmesan. Also, after\n\t\t\t\tpouring the batter into the dish, trace a circle in the batter with your finger, about ½ inch from the\n\t\t\t\tedge of the dish.
