        "title": "Chewy Chocolate Cookies",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Cookie recipes that trumpet their\n\t\t\textreme chocolate flavor always leave us a bit suspicious. While they provide plenty of intensity, these\n\t\t\tover-the-top confections also tend to be delicate and crumbly, more like cakey brownies than cookies. We set\n\t\t\tout to make an exceptionally rich chocolate cookie that we could sink our teeth into without having it fall\n\t\t\tapart. Our first batch, which used modest amounts of cocoa powder and melted chocolate, baked up too cakey\n\t\t\tand tender. The chocolate was the culprit—its fat was softening the dough. We scaled back the\n\t\t\tchocolate until we eliminated it entirely, which made the cookies less cakey and tender, and thus, more\n\t\t\tcookielike. To restore chocolate flavor without adding too much fat, we increased the cocoa powder and\n\t\t\treduced the flour. Using an egg white rather than a whole egg (or yolk) gave us the structure we wanted.\n\t\t\tAdding dark corn syrup gave the cookies a nice chewiness and lent a hint of caramel flavor. For more\n\t\t\trichness, we folded in chopped bittersweet chocolate; the chunks stayed intact and added intense flavor.\n\t\t\tAfter rolling the dough into balls, we dipped them in granulated sugar to give the cookies a sweet crunch\n\t\t\tand an attractive crackled appearance.",

        "title": "Peanut Butter Cookies",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Recipes for peanut butter cookies tend\n\t\t\tto fall into one of two categories: sweet and chewy with a mild peanut flavor, or sandy and crumbly with a\n\t\t\tstrong peanut flavor. We, of course, wanted the best of both worlds—cookies that were crisp on the\n\t\t\tedges and chewy in the center, with lots of peanut flavor. First off, we had to determine the amount and\n\t\t\ttype of sugar. Granulated sugar was necessary for crisp edges and chewy centers, while dark brown sugar\n\t\t\tenriched the peanut flavor. As for flour, too little resulted in an oily cookie, whereas too much made for\n\t\t\tdry cookies. Baking soda contributed to browning and amplified the peanut flavor and baking powder provided\n\t\t\tlift, making both leaveners necessary. Extra-crunchy peanut butter also helped the cookies rise and achieve\n\t\t\ta crispier edge and a softer center. But the best way to get the true peanut flavor we sought was to use\n\t\t\tpeanuts and salt. Adding some roasted salted peanuts, ground in a food processor, and then adding still more\n\t\t\tsalt (directly to the batter as well as in the form of salted rather than unsalted butter) produced a strong\n\t\t\troasted nut flavor without sacrificing anything in terms of texture.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: It’s easy to get carried away and\n\t\t\toverload cookie dough with a crazy jumble of ingredients, resulting in a poorly textured cookie monster. Our\n\t\t\tultimate oatmeal cookie would have just the right amount of added ingredients and an ideal\n\t\t\ttexture—crisp around the edges and chewy in the middle. We wanted to add four flavor\n\t\t\tcomponents—sweet, tangy, nutty, and chocolaty—to the underlying oat flavor. Bittersweet\n\t\t\tchocolate, dried sour cherries, and toasted pecans gave the right balance of flavors. We also analyzed the\n\t\t\tcookie dough ingredients and discovered that cookies made with brown sugar were moister and chewier than\n\t\t\tcookies made with granulated sugar. A combination of baking powder and baking soda (we doubled the usual\n\t\t\tamount) produced cookies that were light and crisp on the outside, but chewy, dense, and soft in the center.\n\t\t\tFinally, we focused on appearance to decide when to remove the cookies from the oven—they should be\n\t\t\tset but still look wet between the fissures; if they look matte rather than shiny, they’ve been overbaked.",

        "title": "Thin and Crispy Oatmeal Cookies",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Thin and crispy oatmeal cookies can be\n\t\t\tirresistible—crunchy and delicate, these cookies really let the flavor of the oats take center stage.\n\t\t\tBut the usual ingredients that give thick, chewy oatmeal cookies great texture—generous amounts of\n\t\t\tsugar and butter, a high ratio of oats to flour, a modest amount of leavener, eggs, raisins, and\n\t\t\tnuts—won’t all fit in a thin, crispy cookie. We wanted to adjust the standard ingredients to create a\n\t\t\tcrispy, delicate cookie in which the simple flavor of buttery oats really stands out. Given this cookie’s\n\t\t\tsimplicity, creating a rich butter flavor was critical, so we kept almost the same amount of butter as in\n\t\t\tour standard big, chewy oatmeal cookie, but we scaled back the amount of sugar. Fine-tuning the amount and\n\t\t\ttype of leavener led to a surprising result that solved our texture and shape problems. During baking, large\n\t\t\tcarbon dioxide bubbles created by the baking soda and baking powder (upped from our traditional recipe)\n\t\t\tcaused the cookies to puff up, collapse, and spread out, producing the thin, flat cookies we were looking\n\t\t\tfor.
