        "title": "Marinara Sauce",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For a multidimensional marinara sauce that would take less than an hour\n\t\t\t\tto prepare, we chose canned whole tomatoes for their flavor and texture, hand-crushing them and removing\n\t\t\t\tthe hard core and stray bits of skin at the same time. A finely chopped onion lent our sauce sweet\n\t\t\t\tflavor. We boosted tomato flavor by sautéing the tomatoes until they glazed the bottom of the pan, after\n\t\t\t\twhich we added their liquid. We also shortened the simmering time by using a skillet instead of a\n\t\t\t\tsaucepan (the greater surface area of a skillet encourages faster evaporation and flavor concentration).\n\t\t\t\tRed wine added depth and complexity and uncooked tomatoes, basil, and olive oil added just before\n\t\t\t\tserving, gave our sauce a bright, fresh finish.",
        "serves": "MAKES 4 CUPS; ENOUGH FOR 1\n\t\t\t\tPOUND OF PASTA Chianti or Merlot work well for the dry red wine.\n\t\t\t\tWe like a smoother marinara, but if you prefer a chunkier sauce, give it just three or four pulses in\n\t\t\t\tthe food processor in step 4.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Like most Roman cooking, pasta alla Amatriciana is bold and brash. We\n\t\t\t\twanted to create a recipe that would do this classic sauce justice, using ingredients found locally. To\n\t\t\t\tstart, we used pancetta, if available (and substituted bacon if not). Diced tomatoes, onion, and red\n\t\t\t\tpepper flakes gave our sauce lively flavor. And adding the cooked pancetta at the end kept it crisp.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4",
        "tip": "This dish is traditionally made with bucatini, also called perciatelli, which appear to\n\t\t\t\tbe thick, round strands but are actually thin, extra-long tubes. Linguine works fine, too. When buying\n\t\t\t\tpancetta, ask the butcher to slice it ¼ inch thick; if using bacon, buy slab bacon and cut\n\t\t\t\tit into ¼-inch-thick slices yourself. If the pancetta that you’re using is very lean, it’s\n\t\t\t\tunlikely that you will need to drain off any fat before adding the onion.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Many recipes for puttanesca produce a dish that is too fishy, too\n\t\t\t\tgarlicky, too briny, or just plain too salty and acidic. Others are timidly flavored and dull. We wanted\n\t\t\t\tto bring out as much flavor as we could from each of the ingredients in our version, while not letting\n\t\t\t\tany one preside over the others. We bloomed the garlic, anchovies, and red pepper flakes in hot olive\n\t\t\t\toil to develop and blend their flavors. Then we added tomatoes and simmered for only 8 minutes to\n\t\t\t\tpreserve their sweetness and meaty texture. A drizzle of olive oil over individual portions adds\n\t\t\t\tmoisture and richness.",

        "title": "Spaghetti alla Carbonara",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Standard carbonara is often a lackluster spaghetti dish—either\n\t\t\t\tcovered in a leaden sauce or riddled with dry bits of cheese. To add to the problems, if the dish gets\n\t\t\t\tto the table a few minutes too late, the sauce congeals and the pasta turns rubbery. We wanted a method\n\t\t\t\tfor producing al dente spaghetti with a velvety sauce punctuated by bits of bacon and a trace of garlic.\n\t\t\t\tWe determined that three whole eggs gave our carbonara superior texture and richness. Combining Pecorino\n\t\t\t\tRomano and Parmesan cheese gave us creaminess with a little bit of bite. Domestic bacon contributed the\n\t\t\t\tperfect crunch and smoky flavor. Combining the hot pasta with the sauce in a warm serving bowl produces\n\t\t\t\ta silky, not clumpy, sauce.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Our goal in developing our pesto was to heighten the basil and subdue the\n\t\t\t\tgarlic flavors so that each major element balanced the other. We started with plenty of fresh basil and\n\t\t\t\tpounded to bruise it and release flavorful oils. Basil usually darkens in homemade pesto, so we boost\n\t\t\t\tthe green color a little by adding parsley. To tame the raw garlic edge, we toasted it, toasting the\n\t\t\t\tnuts as well to give them more intense flavor.
