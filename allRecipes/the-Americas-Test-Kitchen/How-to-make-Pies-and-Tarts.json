        "title": "Key Lime Pie",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Key lime pie often disappoints us\n\t\t\t\twith a harsh and artificial flavor. We wanted a recipe for classic Key lime pie with a fresh flavor and\n\t\t\t\tsilky filling. Traditional Key lime pie is usually not baked; instead, the combination of egg yolks,\n\t\t\t\tlime juice, and sweetened condensed milk firms up when chilled because the juice’s acidity causes the\n\t\t\t\tproteins in the eggs and milk to bind. We found that just one simple swap—from bottled,\n\t\t\t\treconstituted lime juice to juice and zest from fresh limes—gave us a pie that was pungent and\n\t\t\t\trefreshing, cool yet creamy, and very satisfying. We also discovered that while the pie filling will set\n\t\t\t\twithout baking (most recipes call only for mixing and then chilling), it set much more nicely after\n\t\t\t\tbeing baked for only 15 minutes. We tried more dramatic departures from the “classic”\n\t\t\t\trecipe—folding in egg whites, substituting heavy cream for condensed milk—but they didn’t\n\t\t\t\twork. Just two seemingly minor adjustments to the classic recipe made all the difference.",

        "tip": "Despite this pie’s name, we found that most tasters could not tell the difference between\n\t\t\t\tpies made with regular supermarket limes (called Persian limes) and true Key limes. Since Persian limes\n\t\t\t\tare easier to find and juice, we recommend them. The timing here is different from other pies; you need\n\t\t\t\tto make the filling first, then prepare the crust.",

        "title": "Summer Berry Pie",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: A fresh berry pie might seem like\n\t\t\t\tan easy-to-pull-off summer dessert, but most of the recipes we tried buried the berries in gluey\n\t\t\t\tthickeners or embedded them in bouncy gelatin. Our goal was to make a pie with great texture and\n\t\t\t\tflavor—and still keep it simple. We started with the test kitchen’s quick and easy homemade graham\n\t\t\t\tcracker crust, which relies on crushed graham crackers (store-bought graham cracker crumbs often taste\n\t\t\t\tstale). For the filling, we used a combination of raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. After\n\t\t\t\ttrying a few different methods, we found a solution that both bound the berries in the graham cracker\n\t\t\t\tcrust and intensified their bright flavor. We processed a portion of berries in a food processor until\n\t\t\t\tthey made a smooth puree, then we thickened the puree with cornstarch. Next, we tossed the remaining\n\t\t\t\tberries with warm jelly for a glossy coat and a shot of sweetness. Pressed gently into the puree, the\n\t\t\t\tberries stayed put and tasted great.",

        "tip": "Feel free to vary the amount of each berry as desired as long as you have 6 cups of\n\t\t\t\tberries total; do not substitute frozen berries here. Serve with Whipped Cream (page 709).",

        "title": "Chocolate Cookie Crust",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For a quick and easy chocolate\n\t\t\t\tcookie crust, we found that cream-filled Oreo cookies gave us a rich and tender crust. Chocolate wafer\n\t\t\t\tcookies are the more conventional choice for this type of crust, but we found that they tasted bland and\n\t\t\t\ttough. Because of the richness of the filling, swapping in Oreos gave us a supremely tender crust. All\n\t\t\t\tit needed was a bit of melted butter to help the crumbs stick together. We simply processed the cookies\n\t\t\t\tin a food processor until finely ground, pulsed in the melted butter, and pressed the mixture into an\n\t\t\t\teven layer in the pie plate.",

        "tip": "Other brands of chocolate sandwich cookies may be substituted, but avoid “double-filled”\n\t\t\t\tcookies because the proportion of cookie to filling won’t be correct.

        "title": "Chocolate Cream Pie",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Chocolate cream pies can look\n\t\t\t\tsuperb but they’re often gluey, overly sweet, and impossible to slice. We wanted a creamy pie with a\n\t\t\t\twell-balanced chocolate flavor and a delicious, easy-to-slice crust. After testing every type of cookie\n\t\t\t\ton the market, we hit on pulverized Oreos and a bit of melted butter for the tastiest, most tender,\n\t\t\t\tsliceable crumb crust. We found that the secret to perfect chocolate cream pie filling was to combine\n\t\t\t\ttwo different types of chocolate for a deeper, more complex flavor. Bittersweet or semisweet chocolate\n\t\t\t\tprovides the main thrust of flavor and intensely flavored unsweetened chocolate lends depth. One ounce\n\t\t\t\tof unsweetened chocolate may not seem like much, but it gives this pie great flavor. We also discovered\n\t\t\t\tthat the custard’s texture depended upon carefully pouring the egg yolk mixture into simmering\n\t\t\t\thalf-and-half, then whisking in butter",

        "title": "Foolproof Pie Dough",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Pie dough can go wrong so easily:\n\t\t\t\tdry dough that is too crumbly to roll out; a flaky but leathery crust; or a tender crust without flakes.\n\t\t\t\tWe wanted a recipe for pie dough that would roll out easily every time and produce a tender, flaky\n\t\t\t\tcrust. A combination of butter and shortening provided the best balance of flavor and tenderness, and\n\t\t\t\tthe food processor was the best tool to cut the fat into the flour. To ensure pieces of butter that were\n\t\t\t\tthe same size each time, we processed a portion of the flour with the fat until we had a unified paste.\n\t\t\t\tThen we added the reserved flour and pulsed until it was just evenly distributed. In order to roll\n\t\t\t\teasily, dough needs a generous amount of water, but too much water makes crusts tough. We found the\n\t\t\t\tanswer in the liquor cabinet: vodka. While gluten (the protein that makes crust tough) forms readily in\n\t\t\t\twater, it doesn’t form in ethanol, and vodka is 60 percent water and 40 percent ethanol. Replacing some\n\t\t\t\tof the water with vodka produced a moist, easy-to-roll dough that stayed tender. (The alcohol vaporizes\n\t\t\t\tin the oven, so you won’t taste it in the baked crust.)",

        "tip": "Vodka is essential to the tender texture of this crust and imparts no flavor—do not\n\t\t\t\tsubstitute water. This dough is moister than most standard pie doughs and will require lots of flour to\n\t\t\t\troll out (up to ¼ cup). A food processor is essential to making this dough—we don’t\n\t\t\t\trecommend making it by hand. Many recipes that call for partially baking the crust also suggest filling\n\t\t\t\tthe pie shell when it’s still warm and then quickly returning it to the oven. Read recipes carefully and\n\t\t\t\thave the filling ready when the pie shell comes out of the oven if so directed. See Core Techniques on\n\t\t\t\tpages 716–721 for more details on this recipe.",

(Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trolling it out.) 5. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto 375 degrees.
