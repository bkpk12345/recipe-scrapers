        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Skewered chicken can often turn dry\n\t\t\t\tand chalky on the grill. As for the flavor, that’s usually subpar, too, because by the time the barbecue\n\t\t\t\tflavor develops, the meat has dried out. We wanted moist chunks of well-seasoned chicken with full-on\n\t\t\t\tbarbecued flavor. To give us a head start on the flavor we “marinated” the chicken chunks in bacon paste\n\t\t\t\t(made by processing bacon in a food processor) instead of oil, aromatics, and herbs. Tasters liked the\n\t\t\t\tsmoky flavor that the bacon added, but wanted more. Smoked paprika gave the chicken the flavor tasters\n\t\t\t\twere after. For more depth, we also coated the chicken with sweet paprika and turbinado sugar. To keep\n\t\t\t\tthe skewers from drying out, we turned them every two minutes. In the final minutes on the grill, we\n\t\t\t\tbrushed the chicken with a simple barbecue sauce for a final layer of flavor.",

If you have thin pieces of chicken, cut them larger\n\t\t\t\tthan 1 inch and roll or fold them into approximate 1-inch cubes. Turbinado sugar is commonly sold as\n\t\t\t\tSugar in the Raw.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Smoked chicken needs to be cooked\n\t\t\t\tfor a long time to be truly imbued with smoke flavor, but the breast meat dries out easily, and without\n\t\t\t\thigh heat it’s difficult to get the skin to crisp. We wanted a recipe for perfectly cooked meat with a\n\t\t\t\tpervasive smoky flavor and crisp mahogany skin. First, a salt and sugar brine guaranteed moist,\n\t\t\t\twell-seasoned meat. We found that chicken parts were easier and better than whole chickens; the breasts\n\t\t\t\tcould cook evenly on the coolest part of the grill and more of the bird was exposed to the smoke and\n\t\t\t\theat, adding flavor and rendering more fat from the skin. To keep the skin moist, we brushed it with oil\n\t\t\t\tand added a pan of water to the grill. One wood chip packet burned too quickly to permeate the meat, so\n\t\t\t\twe added a second, which produced the ideal amount of smoke for meat subtly flavored all the way\n\t\t\t\tthrough.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Slow-cooked pulled pork is a\n\t\t\t\tsummertime favorite; however, many barbecue procedures demand the regular attention of the cook for\n\t\t\t\teight hours or more. We wanted to find a way to make moist, fork-tender pulled pork without the marathon\n\t\t\t\tcooking time and constant attention to the grill. For the meat, we determined that a shoulder roast\n\t\t\t\t(also called Boston butt), which has significant fat, retained the most moisture and flavor during a\n\t\t\t\tlong, slow cook. We massaged a spicy chili rub into the meat, then wrapped the roast in plastic and\n\t\t\t\trefrigerated it for at least three hours to “marinate.” We cooked the roast first on the grill to absorb\n\t\t\t\tsmoky flavor (from wood chips—no smoker required), then finished it in the oven. Finally, we let\n\t\t\t\tthe pork rest in a paper bag so the meat would steam and any remaining collagen would break down,\n\t\t\t\tallowing the flavorful juices to be reabsorbed.",

Four medium wood chunks, soaked in water for 1 hour, can\n\t\t\t\tbe substituted for the wood chip packets on a charcoal grill.

We thought we’d solve this\n\t\t\t\tissue by throwing our fish on the grill, but this introduced a host of new challenges—curled\n\t\t\t\tfillets that stuck to the grill and spices that tasted raw and harsh. To prevent curling, we scored the\n\t\t\t\tskin. We solved the sticking problem by heavily oiling the grate. Finally, to give the fish its\n\t\t\t\tflavorful “blackened, not burned” coating, we bloomed our spice mixture in melted butter, allowed it to\n\t\t\t\tcool, and then applied the coating to the fish.

While grilling shrimp in\n\t\t\t\ttheir shells can shield them from the coals’ scorching heat, any seasonings are stripped off along with\n\t\t\t\tthe shells when it’s time to eat. For tender, juicy, boldly seasoned grilled shrimp we decided to go\n\t\t\t\twith peeled shrimp and find a way to prevent them from drying out. We seasoned the shrimp with salt,\n\t\t\t\tpepper, and sugar (to help browning) and set them over a very hot fire. This worked well with jumbo\n\t\t\t\tshrimp, but smaller shrimp overcooked before charring. Because jumbo shrimp cost as much as $25 per\n\t\t\t\tpound, we wanted a less expensive solution. We created faux jumbo shrimp by cramming a skewer with\n\t\t\t\tseveral normal-size shrimp pressed tightly together. Our final step was to take the shrimp off the fire\n\t\t\t\tbefore they were completely cooked (but after they had picked up attractive grill marks).
