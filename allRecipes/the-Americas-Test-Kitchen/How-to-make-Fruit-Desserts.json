        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: While some folks like to spoon\n\t\t\t\tstrawberries over pound cake, sponge cake, and even angel food cake, our idea of strawberry shortcake\n\t\t\t\tdefinitely involves a biscuit. We wanted a juicy strawberry filling and mounds of freshly whipped cream\n\t\t\t\tsandwiched in between a lightly sweetened, tender biscuit. While eggs are not traditional, we found that\n\t\t\t\ta single egg gave our biscuits a light, tender texture. And we used just enough dairy (half-and-half or\n\t\t\t\tmilk) to bind the dough together. A modest amount of sugar yielded slightly sweet biscuits. For the\n\t\t\t\tstrawberries, we wanted to avoid both a mushy puree and dry chunks of fruit. We found our solution in a\n\t\t\t\tcompromise—mashing a portion of the berries and slicing the rest for a chunky, juicy mixture that\n\t\t\t\tdidn’t slide off the biscuits. And freshly whipped cream provided a cool, creamy contrast to the berries\n\t\t\t\tand biscuits.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Making peach shortcake with\n\t\t\t\tsupermarket peaches often produces a flavorless filling over a crumbly biscuit. We wanted to develop a\n\t\t\t\trecipe for peach shortcake that would work with farm stand or supermarket peaches. Macerating fruit in\n\t\t\t\tsugar is the traditional method used to pull out the fruit’s juices when it comes to strawberry\n\t\t\t\tshortcake, but for peaches, this step alone isn’t enough. We sliced the peaches very thin to maximize\n\t\t\t\tthe surface that would come in contact with the sugar, then we microwaved a few of the peaches with\n\t\t\t\tpeach schnapps until they were tender, mashing these cooked peaches to create a peach jam. This gave our\n\t\t\t\tshortcakes the right moisture and sweetness. For the shortcakes, we added an egg and mechanically\n\t\t\t\tdeveloped more gluten by vigorously stirring to make a cake that would hold up under the weight of the\n\t\t\t\tfruit. Freshly whipped cream topped off this summer classic.",

We wanted a not-too-thin,\n\t\t\t\tnot-too-thick filling where the blueberry flavor would be front and center. And over the fruit we wanted\n\t\t\t\ta light, tender biscuit topping that could hold its own against the fruit filling, with an ingredient\n\t\t\t\tlist simple enough to allow the blueberries to play the starring role. We started by preparing a filling\n\t\t\t\tusing 6 cups of fresh berries and just enough sugar to sweeten them. Cornstarch worked well to thicken\n\t\t\t\tthe fruit’s juices. A little lemon and cinnamon were all that we needed to enhance the filling without\n\t\t\t\tmasking the blueberry flavor.

During or after baking, the\n\t\t\t\tpastry is broken and pushed into the filling—a technique known as “dowdying.” We found the idea of\n\t\t\t\tan easier approach to apple pie very appealing—no fussy crimping and only one piece of pastry\n\t\t\t\tdough to roll out—so we set out to make our own version. For a juicy apple filling with bright\n\t\t\t\tfruit flavor, we added cider to the apples and sweetened them with maple syrup, both of which made for a\n\t\t\t\tpleasantly saucy filling. Parcooking the apples in a skillet until caramelized before adding the other\n\t\t\t\tingredients helped to deepen their flavor. For the crust, we cut a standard pie crust into squares after\n\t\t\t\trolling it over the fruit right in the skillet—this encouraged a multitude of crisp edges that\n\t\t\t\tcontrasted nicely with the tender fruit and recalled (in a less dowdy way) the broken-up crusts of a\n\t\t\t\ttraditional pandowdy.",

We wanted an exemplary apple\n\t\t\t\tcrisp—a lush (but not mushy) sweet-tart apple filling covered with truly crisp morsels of buttery,\n\t\t\t\tsugary topping. Our first few crisps contained unevenly cooked apples lacking any fruity punch. Stirring\n\t\t\t\tthe fruit helped solve the texture problem, but reaching into a hot oven to do so was a hassle. Instead,\n\t\t\t\twe softened the apples on the stovetop—in a skillet. The shallow, flared pan also encouraged\n\t\t\t\tevaporation, browning, and better flavor overall. To improve the flavor further, we turned to apple\n\t\t\t\tcider, reducing it to a syrupy consistency. As for the topping, we added brown sugar to white to play up\n\t\t\t\tthe apples’ caramel notes, and swapped out some flour for rolled oats to give the topping character and\n\t\t\t\tchew. Chopped pecans not only improved the crunch factor, but added rich flavor as well. After a few\n\t\t\t\tminutes in the oven, our crisp was just that.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Poaching is one of the simplest\n\t\t\t\tways of preparing ripe, seasonal fruit. But the timing can be tricky: How long do you cook the fruit so\n\t\t\t\tthat it is tender but not mushy? We experimented with a variety of methods and learned that the trick\n\t\t\t\twas not to cook the fruit at all. Submerging the raw fruit in simmering syrup and allowing it to steep\n\t\t\t\toff the heat for 30 minutes worked perfectly. The fruit was tender, sweet, and permeated with the\n\t\t\t\tsyrup’s flavor, but never mushy.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4 TO 6",
        "tip": "This recipe works best with just-ripened pears that are neither too soft nor too hard.\n\t\t\t\tAlthough these poached pears taste great on their own, you can serve them with ice cream, Crème Anglaise\n\t\t\t\t(page 776), lightly sweetened and whipped crème fraîche, or cheese, such as a blue.",
        "ingredients": "[\"1½  cups water\",\"½  cup sugar\",\"½ vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds removed andreserved\",\"4 pears (8 ounces each), peeled, halved, and cored\"]",
        "instructions": "[\"1. Bring water, sugar, and vanilla bean and seeds to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboil in medium saucepan, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Add pears, turn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toff heat, cover, and let sit off heat until mixture cools to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\",\"2. Remove vanilla bean. Refrigerate pears and poaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliquid, in saucepan, until well chilled, at least 2 hours. Spoon fruit and poaching liquid into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual bowls and serve.

        "title": "Pavlovas",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Pavlova is simple to prepare, yet it’s\n\t\t\toften plagued by soggy, sickly sweet meringue and unripe fruit—and cutting it for serving is a messy\n\t\t\tproposition. We were seeking a pavlova made of pure white, perfectly crisped meringue, its texture softened\n\t\t\tby whipped cream and its sweetness balanced by a fresh fruit topping. First, we opted to take a restaurant\n\t\t\tapproach and make individual pavlovas for tidier presentation. Then we focused on making and baking the\n\t\t\tmeringue. Whipping room-temperature egg whites with a small amount of cream of tartar and vanilla before\n\t\t\tslowly adding the sugar gave us a voluminous, billowy, stable meringue. To shape the meringues, we portioned\n\t\t\t½ cup of the mixture into small mounds on a baking sheet, then used the back of a spoon to\n\t\t\tcreate indentations for holding the whipped cream and fruit. Baking the meringues at 200 degrees for an hour\n\t\t\tand a half yielded perfectly dry, crisp, white shells. Gradually cooling them in the turned-off oven ensured\n\t\t\ttheir crispness. While we especially liked the flavors of tropical fruit on the pavlovas, fresh berries and\n\t\t\tpeaches made fine options too. For the whipped cream topping, we added sour cream for a slight tang that\n\t\t\tprovided a cool, refreshing counterpoint to the sweet fruit and meringues.",
        "serves": "SERVES 6",
        "tip": "Be mindful that the fruit is the garnish here, so it’s worth taking the time to cut it into\n\t\t\ttidy pieces. Sour cream gives the whipped cream a slight tang; omit it if you prefer simple whipped cream.\n\t\t\tAvoid making pavlovas on humid days or the meringue shells will turn out sticky. See Recipe Tutorial on page\n\t\t\t697 for more details on this recipe.",
        "ingredients": "[\"MERINGUES AND FRUIT\",\"4 large egg whites, room temperature\",\"¾  teaspoon vanilla extract\",\"¼  teaspoon cream of tartar\",\"1 cup (7 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon sugar\",\"1  mango, peeled, pitted, and cut into¼-inch pieces\",\"2 kiwis, peeled, quartered, and sliced thin\",\"1½ cups ½-inch pineapplepieces\"]",
        "instructions": "[\"2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites,\\n\\t\\t\\tvanilla, and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high\\n\\t\\t\\tand whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add 1 cup sugar and whip until glossy,\\n\\t\\t\\tstiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes.\",\"3. Scoop six ½-cup mounds of meringue onto\\n\\t\\t\\tprepared sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Gently make small, bowl-like indentation in each meringue\\n\\t\\t\\tusing back of spoon. Bake until meringues have smooth, dry, and firm exteriors, about 1½ hours.\\n\\t\\t\\tTurn oven off and leave meringues in oven until completely dry and hard, about 2 hours. (Meringue shells can\\n\\t\\t\\tbe stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.) 4. Gently toss mango, kiwis, and pineapple with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in\\n\\t\\t\\tlarge bowl. Let sit at room temperature until sugar has dissolved and fruit is juicy, about 30 minutes.\"]"

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: The lightly sweetened flavor and creamy\n\t\t\ttexture of whipped cream make the perfect partner to numerous desserts, especially pies. But perfect whipped\n\t\t\tcream can be hard to accomplish—the cream can go from properly whipped to overwhipped and stiff in a\n\t\t\tmatter of seconds. For puffy, cloudlike mounds, we reached for our stand mixer and began whipping the cream\n\t\t\tand sugar on medium-low speed, then increased the speed and whipped just until the mixture was thick and\n\t\t\tbillowy. For flavor, we added a dash of vanilla.",
