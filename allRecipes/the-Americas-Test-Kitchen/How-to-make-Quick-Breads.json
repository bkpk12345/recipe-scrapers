        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Too many drop biscuits are dense,\n\t\t\t\tgummy, and doughy, or lean and dry; we wanted a biscuit that could be easily broken apart and eaten\n\t\t\t\tpiece by buttery piece. While oil-based biscuits are easy to work with, they lack flavor; butter was a\n\t\t\t\tmust. Buttermilk instead of milk gave the biscuits a rich, buttery tang and made them crisper on the\n\t\t\t\texterior and fluffier on the interior. In terms of leavener, we needed a substantial amount, but too\n\t\t\t\tmuch baking powder left a metallic taste. Replacing some of the baking powder with baking soda gave the\n\t\t\t\tbiscuits the rise they needed without the metallic bitterness. Now we were left with only one problem.\n\t\t\t\tProperly combining the butter and buttermilk requires that both ingredients be at just the right\n\t\t\t\ttemperature; if they aren’t, the melted butter clumps in the buttermilk. Since this was supposed to be\n\t\t\t\tan easy recipe, we tried making a batch with the lumpy buttermilk. The result was a surprisingly better\n\t\t\t\tbiscuit, slightly higher and with better texture. The water in the lumps of butter turned to steam in\n\t\t\t\tthe oven, helping create additional height.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: The oatmeal scones served in a typical\n\t\t\tcoffeehouse are so dry and leaden that they seem like a ploy to get people to buy more coffee to wash them\n\t\t\tdown. We wanted rich toasted oat flavor in a tender, flaky, not-too-sweet scone. Whole rolled oats and quick\n\t\t\toats performed better than instant and steel-cut oats, and toasting the oats brought out their nutty flavor.\n\t\t\tWe used a minimal amount of sugar and baking powder, but plenty of cold butter. A mixture of milk and heavy\n\t\t\tcream added richness without making these scones too heavy. An egg proved to be the ultimate touch of\n\t\t\trichness. Cutting the cold butter into the flour, instead of using melted butter, resulted in a lighter\n\t\t\ttexture. A very hot oven made the scones rise spectacularly, gave them a craggy appearance, and meant less\n\t\t\ttime in the oven and therefore less time to dry out.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: More often berries weigh down scones\n\t\t\tand impart little flavor. Starting with traditional recipes, we increased the amounts of sugar and butter to\n\t\t\tadd sweetness and richness; a combination of whole milk and sour cream lent more richness and tang. For\n\t\t\tlightness, we borrowed a technique from puff pastry, where the dough is turned, rolled, and folded multiple\n\t\t\ttimes to create layers that are forced apart by steam when baked. To ensure that the butter would stay as\n\t\t\tcold and solid as possible while baking, we froze it and grated it into the dry ingredients using a coarse\n\t\t\tgrater. Adding the blueberries to the dry ingredients meant they got mashed when we mixed the dough, but\n\t\t\twhen we added them to the already-mixed dough, we ruined our pockets of butter. The solution was pressing\n\t\t\tthe berries into the dough, rolling the dough into a log, then pressing the log into a rectangle and cutting\n\t\t\tthe scones.",
        "serves": "MAKES 8 SCONES",

In hot or humid environments, chill the flour mixture and\n\t\t\tmixing bowls before use.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: To tame the harsh bite of the\n\t\t\tcranberries found in most cranberry-nut muffins, we chopped the cranberries in a food processor and tossed\n\t\t\tthem with confectioners’ sugar and a little salt (which we often use to tame the bitterness in eggplant). As\n\t\t\tfor the nuts, we took a cue from cakes made with nut flour and augmented some of the all-purpose flour with\n\t\t\tpecan flour (made by grinding pecans in a food processor). These muffins boasted a rich, hearty crumb. But\n\t\t\tbecause we were working with less flour, our muffins spread rather than baking up tall and self-contained.\n\t\t\tWe fixed the problem by letting the batter rest for 30 minutes. This allowed what flour there was to become\n\t\t\tmore hydrated, resulting in a properly thickened batter that baked up perfectly domed.

        "title": "Blueberry Swirl Muffins",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Too often, the blueberry flavor in\n\t\t\tblueberry muffins is fleeting, thanks to the fact that the berries in the produce aisle have suffered from\n\t\t\tlong-distance shipping. We wanted blueberry muffins that put the berry flavor at the forefront and would\n\t\t\ttaste great even with watery supermarket berries. When we combined blueberry jam with fresh supermarket\n\t\t\tblueberries, the muffins baked up with a pretty blue filling, but the jam made them too sweet. Instead, we\n\t\t\tmade our own low-sugar jam by simmering fresh blueberries with a bit of sugar. Adding our jam to the batter\n\t\t\talong with fresh, uncooked berries gave our muffins intense blueberry flavor and the liquid burst that only\n\t\t\tfresh berries could provide. As for the muffin base, we found that the quick-bread method—whisking\n\t\t\ttogether eggs and sugar before adding milk and melted butter, then gently folding in the dry\n\t\t\tingredients—produced a hearty, substantial crumb that could support a generous amount of fruit. An\n\t\t\tequal amount of butter and oil created just the right buttery flavor and moist, tender texture. To make the\n\t\t\tmuffins even richer, we swapped the whole milk for buttermilk.

We tested bran cereal from\n\t\t\t\tthe supermarket and found that twig-style cereal worked better than flakes, but soaking the twigs in\n\t\t\t\tmilk, as most recipes recommend, left our muffins dense and heavy. Instead, we stirred together the wet\n\t\t\t\tingredients, then added the cereal. Grinding half of the twigs in the food processor and leaving the\n\t\t\t\trest whole gave the muffins the right texture. Whole-milk yogurt, plus butter, added needed moisture to\n\t\t\t\tthe batter. Molasses and brown sugar reinforced the earthy bran flavor. To address the texture of the\n\t\t\t\tmuffins, we switched to baking soda instead of baking powder and used one egg plus a yolk—two eggs\n\t\t\t\tmade the muffins too springy.
