        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Roasting is a great way to deepen\n\t\t\t\tthe flavor of vegetables, but broccoli can be tricky to roast given its awkward shape, dense, woody\n\t\t\t\tstalks, and shrubby florets. We wanted a roasted broccoli recipe that would give us evenly cooked\n\t\t\t\tbroccoli—stalks and florets—and add concentrated flavor and dappled browning. The way we\n\t\t\t\tprepared the broccoli was the key. We cut each crown into uniform wedges. We cut the stalks into\n\t\t\t\trectangular pieces slightly smaller than the more delicate wedges. This promoted even cooking and great\n\t\t\t\tbrowning by maximizing the vegetable’s contact with the baking sheet. Tossing a scant ½ teaspoon of\n\t\t\t\tsugar over the broccoli along with salt, pepper, and a few tablespoons of olive oil gave us blistered,\n\t\t\t\tbubbled, and browned stalks that were sweet and full flavored, along with crisp-tipped florets.",

To make glazed carrots a one-pot operation, we steamed them\n\t\t\t\tdirectly in the skillet, and we used chicken broth rather than water (along with some salt and sugar)\n\t\t\t\tfor fuller flavor. When the carrots were almost tender, we removed the lid and turned up the heat to\n\t\t\t\treduce the cooking liquid.

Instead,\n\t\t\t\twe covered the potatoes with foil for the first 20 minutes of cooking so that they would steam in their\n\t\t\t\town moisture.

Waxy\n\t\t\t\tpotatoes were too watery and fried up with hollow cavities that simply filled with oil. Russet potatoes\n\t\t\t\tturned out to be the best choice, but because they are starchy, we found it was important to rinse the\n\t\t\t\tstarch off the surface after cutting the potatoes. Refrigerating the potatoes for at least 30 minutes in\n\t\t\t\twater made lighter, crispier fries and improved their browning. Coating the fries in a little cornstarch\n\t\t\t\tprior to cooking absorbed some of the surface moisture on the potatoes and created a protective sheath\n\t\t\t\tthat turned into a shatteringly crisp crust once fried. We preferred our fries cooked in peanut oil but\n\t\t\t\tvegetable oil was a good second choice.

We braised sliced sweet potatoes in a mixture of butter\n\t\t\t\tand heavy cream to impart a smooth richness.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: After what seems like eons in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe oven, acorn squash often lands on the table with little flavor and a dry, grainy texture. We\n\t\t\t\t\twanted perfectly cooked squash with a sweet, nutty flavor and moist flesh—without taking\n\t\t\t\t\thours. Microwaving turned out to be the winning cooking method, resulting in squash that was tender\n\t\t\t\t\tand silky, with nary a trace of dryness or stringiness. We found it was best to halve and seed the\n\t\t\t\t\tsquash before cooking; whole pierced squash cooked unevenly. Equal portions of butter and dark brown\n\t\t\t\t\tsugar gave the squash ample but not excessive sweetness.

If microwaving the squash in Pyrex, the\n\t\t\t\tmanufacturer recommends adding water to the dish (or bowl) prior to cooking. If you are cooking the\n\t\t\t\tsquash in a bowl, you will need one that holds about 4 quarts. See “Winter\n\t\t\t\t\tSquash: Seeding Safely”.",
