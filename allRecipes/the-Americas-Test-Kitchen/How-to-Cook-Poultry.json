        "title": "Sautéed Turkey Cutlets",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Turkey cutlets offer a quick,\n\t\t\tsatisfying option for a weeknight dinner. Choosing cutlets of even thickness was the first step in ensuring\n\t\t\tthat they cooked uniformly from end to end. We found it wasn’t necessary to flour the cutlets as long as the\n\t\t\tpan was hot enough, and olive oil was the best medium for sautéing the cutlets, providing pleasant flavor\n\t\t\tand a relatively high smoke point. Heating the pan properly was essential to a well-browned crust. Finally,\n\t\t\twe determined it was best to brown the cutlets on one side only; they are simply too thin to brown well on\n\t\t\tboth sides without overcooking.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4",
        "tip": "One cutlet per person makes a skimpy serving, so we call for a total of six to serve four\n\t\t\tpeople. If you prefer, replace the Honey-Mustard Pan Sauce with “Warm-Spiced\n\t\t\t\tPan Sauce with Currants and Almonds”. If not making a pan sauce, let the turkey rest for 5 minutes\n\t\t\tbefore serving in step 2.",

        "instructions": "[\"2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over\\n\\t\\t\\tmedium-high heat. Place half of cutlets in skillet and cook until light golden brown on first side, 2 to\\n\\t\\t\\t2½ minutes. Flip cutlets and continue to cook until second side is opaque, about 1 minute;\\n\\t\\t\\ttransfer to large ovensafe platter.

        "title": "Crisp Breaded Chicken Cutlets",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Most chicken cutlets offer a thin,\n\t\t\tuneven, pale crust; we wanted a thick, crisp, flavorful coating that stayed put. We found that pounding the\n\t\t\tchicken ensured the cutlets would cook evenly. Homemade bread crumbs were a must, providing a subtly sweet\n\t\t\tflavor and light, crisp texture, while adding a little oil to our egg wash allowed the crust to brown more\n\t\t\tdeeply. Finally, pan-frying the cutlets two at a time (rather than four) reduced the amount of steam in the\n\t\t\tskillet, allowing the breading to crisp and brown evenly.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4",
        "tip": "If you’d rather not prepare fresh bread crumbs, use panko, the extra-crisp Japanese bread\n\t\t\tcrumbs. The chicken is cooked in batches of two because the crust is noticeably more crisp if the pan is not\n\t\t\tovercrowded.",

        "title": "Chicken Saltimbocca",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Chicken saltimbocca is a new spin on an\n\t\t\told Italian classic, veal saltimbocca. It sounds promising, but adaptations typically take this dish too far\n\t\t\tfrom its roots. We wanted to avoid overcomplicating things and give each main element—chicken,\n\t\t\tprosciutto, sage—its due. Flouring the chicken first allowed the chicken to brown evenly and prevented\n\t\t\tgummy, uncooked spots. Using thinly sliced prosciutto prevented its flavor from overwhelming the dish. A\n\t\t\tsingle sage leaf is the usual garnish, but we wanted more sage flavor, so, in addition to a whole leaf\n\t\t\tgarnish, we also sprinkled some chopped fresh sage over the floured chicken before adding the prosciutto.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4",
        "tip": "Make sure to buy prosciutto that is thinly sliced, not shaved; also avoid slices that are too\n\t\t\tthick, as they won’t stick to the chicken. The prosciutto slices should be large enough to fully cover one\n\t\t\tside of each cutlet. To make slicing the chicken easier, freeze it for 15 minutes. Although whole sage\n\t\t\tleaves make a beautiful presentation, they are optional and can be left out of step 3. See “How to Make Chicken Cutlets” for more details on cutting chicken breasts\n\t\t\tinto cutlets.",

        "title": "Chicken Marsala",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Chicken Marsala is an Italian\n\t\t\trestaurant staple that sounds promising, but often disappoints, with watery sauce, dry chicken, and\n\t\t\tovercooked, slimy mushrooms. To rescue this dish, we began by determining the best way to cook it. Not\n\t\t\tsurprisingly, the classic method of sautéing the meat, then using the browned bits left behind as a flavor\n\t\t\tbase for the sauce, was the way to go. Adding some pancetta to the skillet after cooking the chicken gave\n\t\t\tour dish a flavor boost, and also provided rendered fat in which to cook the mushrooms; this allowed them to\n\t\t\tbrown and crisp. For the sauce, we found that using sweet Marsala—and no chicken broth—was best;\n\t\t\treducing it concentrated its flavor, while a little lemon juice tempered the Marsala’s sweetness. We\n\t\t\tfinished our sauce with butter for a silky richness.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4",
        "tip": "Our wine of choice for this dish is Sweet Marsala Fine, an imported wine that gives the sauce\n\t\t\tbody, soft edges, and a smooth finish.

        "title": "Chicken Pot Pie with Savory Crumble Topping\n\t\t",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For a streamlined chicken pot pie\n\t\t\trecipe, we poached boneless, skinless breasts and thighs in chicken broth, which we then used as the\n\t\t\tfoundation of a full-bodied sauce. We opted for the traditional vegetable combination of onion, carrots, and\n\t\t\tcelery and sautéed them separately to preserve their texture. To add chicken flavor to our chicken pot pie’s\n\t\t\tsauce, we stirred a butter-and-flour roux into milk and the poaching liquid and used sautéed mushrooms, soy\n\t\t\tsauce, and tomato paste to enhance its savory character. Sweet, bright green frozen peas required no\n\t\t\tprecooking—just a stir into the filling. Every chicken pot pie recipe—even a speedy\n\t\t\tone—needs a crisp, buttery top, so we settled on a “crumble” crust. It was a snap to prepare, and a\n\t\t\tquick stay in the oven before topping the pot pie with it made sure the savory crumble crust cooked through\n\t\t\tand crisped up once baked on top of the pot pie.",
