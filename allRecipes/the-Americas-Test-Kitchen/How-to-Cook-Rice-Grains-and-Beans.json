We sautéed onion in our\n\t\t\t\tpan first for an easy flavor boost, then we added the rice. Toasting the rice for a few minutes in the\n\t\t\t\tpan deepened its flavor. When it came to the liquid, instead of following the traditional ratio of 1:2\n\t\t\t\tfor rice and water, we found using a little less delivered better results.

Sautéing\n\t\t\t\tthe rice in vegetable oil before adding the liquid produced superior grains. We found that equal parts\n\t\t\t\tchicken broth and fresh tomatoes (combined in a 2:1 ratio with the rice) were ideal for a flavorful\n\t\t\t\tbase. For flavor, color, and texture, we added a little tomato paste and stirred the rice midway through\n\t\t\t\tcooking to reincorporate the tomato mixture. Baking the rice ensured even cooking.

First, we\n\t\t\t\tswapped out the saucepan for a Dutch oven, which has a thick, heavy bottom, deep sides, and\n\t\t\t\ttight-fitting lid—perfect for trapping and distributing heat as evenly as possible. Typical\n\t\t\t\trecipes dictate adding the broth in small increments after the wine has been absorbed (and stirring\n\t\t\t\tconstantly after each addition), but we added most of the broth at once and covered the pan, allowing\n\t\t\t\tthe rice to simmer until almost all the broth had been absorbed (stirring just twice). After adding the\n\t\t\t\tsecond and final addition of broth, we stirred the pot to ensure the bottom didn’t cook more quickly\n\t\t\t\tthan the top and turned off the heat.

        "title": "Millet Porridge with Maple Syrup",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: The mellow corn flavor and fine\n\t\t\t\ttexture of tiny millet seeds make them extremely versatile in both savory and sweet applications. During\n\t\t\t\tour testing, we discovered that slightly overcooking millet causes the seeds to burst and release\n\t\t\t\tstarch, creating a creamy consistency that makes a great breakfast porridge. We cooked the millet in\n\t\t\t\twater until it was almost tender, then added milk to the pan to finish cooking it through and add\n\t\t\t\trichness. Simple flavorings of maple syrup and cinnamon were all it needed.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4",

        "title": "Quinoa Salad with Red Bell Pepper and Cilantro",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Though it’s technically a seed, we\n\t\t\t\ttypically treat quinoa as we would a grain, serving it as a side dish or lunchtime salad. We rinsed the\n\t\t\t\tgrains to remove the bitter protective layer, then toasted them to bring out flavor before adding liquid\n\t\t\t\tto the pan. Spreading the cooked quinoa over a rimmed baking sheet to cool produced the fluffiest\n\t\t\t\tgrains. We found we needed a little more liquid than our usual 1:1 quinoa-to-water ratio because we were\n\t\t\t\tserving this quinoa at room temperature. The extra cooking liquid ensured the grains stayed fluffy and\n\t\t\t\tseparate as they cooled on the baking sheet. Given its South American origins, jalapeño, red onion,\n\t\t\t\tcilantro, and bell pepper made sense as add-ins. A bright dressing with lime juice, garlic, and cumin\n\t\t\t\tbrought it all together.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4",
        "tip": "Do not add oil or butter to the pot when toasting the quinoa, as it will make the grains\n\t\t\t\ttaste slightly bitter. To make this dish spicier, add the chile seeds. After 12 minutes of cooking,\n\t\t\t\tthere will still be a little bit of water in the pan, but this will evaporate as the quinoa cools.",
        "ingredients": "[\"1 cup quinoa, rinsed and dried on dish towel\",\"1½ cups water\",\"Salt and pepper\",\"½  red bell pepper, chopped fine\",\"½  jalapeño chile, minced\",\"2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion\",\"1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro\",\"2 tablespoons lime juice\",\"1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\",\"2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\",\"1 small garlic clove, minced\",\"½ teaspoon ground cumin\"]",
        "instructions": "[\"1. Toast quinoa in large saucepan over medium heat,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstirring often, until quinoa is lightly toasted and aromatic, about 5 minutes. Stir in water and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t¼ teaspoon salt and bring to simmer.

        "title": "Wheat Berry Salad with Orange and Scallions",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Since wheat berries remain firm,\n\t\t\t\tsmooth, and distinct when cooked, they lend themselves to a salad nicely. We found it easiest to cook\n\t\t\t\tthe kernels like pasta, simply simmering the wheat berries in a large amount of water. After an hour of\n\t\t\t\tsimmering, they had good texture, but we were disappointed to find that the flavor had been somewhat\n\t\t\t\tdiluted by the water. Just ¼ teaspoon of salt boosted the flavor of the grains; any more\n\t\t\t\tsalt and the salinity of the water prevented the wheat berries from absorbing the water, making the\n\t\t\t\tgrains hard and crunchy. Their rich, earthy flavor paired well with a citrusy dressing sweetened with a\n\t\t\t\ttouch of honey, while shredded carrots and minced scallions lent color and fresh flavor.",
