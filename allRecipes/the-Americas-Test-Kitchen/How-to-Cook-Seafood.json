        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: The best versions of fish meunière feature perfectly cooked fillets that are delicately crisp\n\t\t\t\tand golden brown on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside, napped with a buttery yet light\n\t\t\t\tsauce. Whole Dover sole is the most authentic choice, but it’s also prohibitively expensive; either sole\n\t\t\t\tor flounder fillets proved to be good stand-ins. To prevent the likelihood of overcooking the fish, the\n\t\t\t\tfillets needed to be no less than 3⁄8 inch\n\t\t\t\tthick. For the perfect coating, there was no need to use eggs or bread crumbs. We simply dried the\n\t\t\t\tfillets, seasoned them with salt and pepper, and allowed them to sit for five minutes, in which time\n\t\t\t\tbeads of moisture appeared on the fillets’ surface. Then we simply dredged the fillets in flour. A\n\t\t\t\tnonstick skillet coated with a mixture of oil and butter prevented sticking. For the sauce, we browned\n\t\t\t\tthe butter in a traditional skillet (so the changing color was easy to monitor), and brightened it with\n\t\t\t\tlemon juice, then poured the mixture over the fish.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4 TO 6",
        "tip": "Try to purchase fillets that are of similar size, and avoid those that weigh less than 5\n\t\t\t\tounces because they will cook too quickly. A nonstick skillet ensures that the fillets will release from\n\t\t\t\tthe pan, but for the sauce a traditional skillet is preferable because its light-colored surface will\n\t\t\t\tallow you to monitor the color of the butter as it browns. See “Classic\n\t\t\t\t\tFish Meunière” for more details on this recipe.",

        "title": "Lemony Steamed Fish",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Not only is steaming a quick and\n\t\t\t\teasy cooking method for fish fillets, but it also keeps the fish moist and its flavor pure. We found\n\t\t\t\tthat the key to perfectly steamed fish was to simmer the water underneath the steamer basket rather than\n\t\t\t\tlet it boil. The gentle heat helped the fish cook slowly and evenly. For very thin fish fillets, such as\n\t\t\t\tsole, we found that rolling the fish into bundles before putting them in the basket ensured they stayed\n\t\t\t\tmoist, didn’t overcook, and were easy to remove in one piece once cooked. Surrounding the fish with\n\t\t\t\tlemon (or other citrus) slices as it steamed gave the fish a delicate, fresh flavor.",

        "tip": "We use sole here, but many types of fish can be prepared using this method; see “Cooking Times for Steamed Fish”. Note that only very thin fish\n\t\t\t\tfillets (less than ½ inch thick) need to be rolled into bundles before cooking. Limes,\n\t\t\t\toranges, or grapefruits can be substituted for the lemons. Serve with one of the following sauces, if\n\t\t\t\tdesired; these sauces also work well when paired with “Oven-Roasted\n\t\t\t\t\tSalmon”.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Pan-roasting fish seems like a\n\t\t\t\tsimple task, but it often results in dry, overbaked fillets. We quickly learned we needed thick fillets;\n\t\t\t\tskinnier pieces overcooked by the time they achieved a serious sear. We then turned to a common\n\t\t\t\trestaurant method to cook the fish: We seared the fillets in a hot pan, flipped them, then transferred\n\t\t\t\tthe pan to a hot oven to finish cooking. Sprinkling the fillets with sugar accelerated browning on the\n\t\t\t\tstovetop, shortening the cooking time and thus ensuring the fish didn’t dry out. After a short stay in\n\t\t\t\tthe oven to finish cooking through, the fish emerged well browned, tender and moist, and best of all,\n\t\t\t\tnot one taster detected any out-of-place sweetness.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4",
        "tip": "Thick white fish fillets with a meaty texture, like halibut, cod, sea bass, or red\n\t\t\t\tsnapper, work best in this recipe. Most fish fillets differ in thickness; some pieces may finish cooking\n\t\t\t\tbefore others. Be sure to immediately remove each fillet when it reaches 135 degrees. You will need a\n\t\t\t\t12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet for this recipe. See “How to Pan-Roast\n\t\t\t\t\tFish” for more details on this recipe.",

        "title": "Pan-Roasted Halibut Steaks",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Chefs often choose to braise\n\t\t\t\thalibut instead of pan-roasting or sautéing because this moist-heat cooking technique keeps the fish\n\t\t\t\tfrom drying out. The problem is that braising doesn’t allow for browning, which adds great flavor to\n\t\t\t\tfish. We didn’t want to make any compromises on either texture or flavor, so we set out to develop a\n\t\t\t\ttechnique for cooking halibut that would produce perfectly cooked, moist, and tender fish with good\n\t\t\t\tbrowning. A combination of pan searing and oven roasting proved best. To be sure the steaks wouldn’t\n\t\t\t\tovercook, we seared them on one side in a piping hot skillet, then turned them over before placing them\n\t\t\t\tin the oven to finish cooking through. When they were done, the steaks were browned but still moist\n\t\t\t\tinside. To complement the lean fish, we developed a couple of flavored butters and a bright vinaigrette.",

        "tip": "If you plan to serve the fish with a flavored butter or sauce (recipes follow), prepare\n\t\t\t\tit before cooking the fish. Even well-dried fish can cause the hot oil in the pan to splatter. You can\n\t\t\t\tminimize splattering by laying the halibut steaks in the pan gently and putting the edge closest to you\n\t\t\t\tin the pan first so the far edge falls away from you.",

Fresh bread crumbs created the best coating.\n\t\t\t\tTo avoid soft, undercooked crumbs, we started by adding melted butter while processing the bread crumbs,\n\t\t\t\tand then crisped the crumbs in the oven. We dipped the fillets first in flour and then in a thick wash\n\t\t\t\tmade from eggs and mayonnaise before applying the browned crumbs. Placing the coated fish on a wire rack\n\t\t\t\twhile baking allowed air to circulate, crisping all sides.
