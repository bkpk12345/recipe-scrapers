        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Pan-searing thick-cut steaks poses\n\t\t\t\tone main problem—by the time a good crust has developed and the very center is a rosy medium-rare,\n\t\t\t\tthe rest of the meat is dry and gray. We needed to find a way to quickly sear the exterior while slowly\n\t\t\t\tcooking the interior to allow for more even heat distribution. We tried flipping the steaks every 15\n\t\t\t\tseconds and also pan-roasting them (searing them on the stovetop then moving the skillet to a hot oven),\n\t\t\t\tbut neither approach was practical or worked very well. The key turned out to be starting the steaks in\n\t\t\t\ta warm oven and then quickly searing them to keep the meat directly under the crust from turning gray.\n\t\t\t\tCooked this way, the steaks developed a beautiful brown crust, while the rest of the meat stayed pink,\n\t\t\t\tjuicy, and tender.",

When cooking lean strip steaks (without an external\n\t\t\t\tfat cap) or filet mignon, add an extra tablespoon of oil to the pan.

It may be lean, but it typically needs a serious\n\t\t\t\tflavor boost. We wanted to explore the glories of old-fashioned, more flavorful (read: less lean) pork.\n\t\t\t\tOne such cut is the shoulder roast. It may take longer to cook, but it’s also inexpensive, loaded with\n\t\t\t\tflavorful intramuscular fat, and boasts a thick fat cap that renders to a bronze, baconlike crust. We\n\t\t\t\tstarted by rubbing the roast’s exterior with brown sugar and salt, then left it to rest overnight. The\n\t\t\t\tsugar dried out the exterior and boosted browning. Elevating the pork shoulder on a V-rack and pouring\n\t\t\t\twater in the roasting pan kept the pork’s drippings from burning as it roasted. It also created a\n\t\t\t\tsignificant jus. Finally, a fruity sauce with sweet and sour elements cut the pork shoulder’s richness.",

        "instructions": "[\"1. Toss beef and 1½ teaspoons salt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether in bowl and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.\",\"2. Adjust oven racks to lower-middle and lowest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpositions and heat oven to 500 degrees. Place salt pork, beef scraps, and 2 tablespoons butter in large\\n\\t\\t\\t\\troasting pan. Roast on lower-middle rack until well browned and fat has rendered, 15 to 20 minutes.\",\"3. While salt pork and beef scraps roast, toss cremini\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmushrooms, pearl onions, remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and sugar together on rimmed baking sheet. Roast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton lowest rack, stirring occasionally, until moisture released by mushrooms evaporates and vegetables\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare lightly glazed, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer vegetables to large bowl, cover, and refrigerate.\",\"4. Remove roasting pan from oven and reduce\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemperature to 325 degrees. Sprinkle flour over rendered fat and whisk until no dry flour remains. Whisk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin broth, 2 cups wine, gelatin, tomato paste, and anchovy paste until combined. Add onions, carrots,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgarlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, porcini mushrooms, parsley sprigs, and thyme sprigs to pan. Arrange\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeef in single layer on top of vegetables. Add water as needed to come three-quarters up side of beef\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(beef should not be submerged). Return roasting pan to oven and cook until meat is tender, 3 to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t3½ hours, stirring after 90 minutes and adding water to keep meat at least half-submerged.\",\"5. Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to bowl with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcremini mushrooms and pearl onions; cover and set aside. Strain braising liquid through fine-mesh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrainer set over large bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStir in remaining wine and let cooking liquid settle, 10 minutes. Using wide, shallow spoon, skim fat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toff surface and discard.\",\"6. Transfer liquid to Dutch oven and bring mixture to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboil over medium-high heat. Simmer briskly, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsistency of heavy cream, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, stir in beef and mushroom-onion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgarnish, cover, and cook until just heated through, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaste. Stir in minced parsley and serve. (Stew can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)\"]"
