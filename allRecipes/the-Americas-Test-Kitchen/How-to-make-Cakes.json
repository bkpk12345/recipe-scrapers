        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: We wanted a simple coffee cake that\n\t\t\t\twasn’t a chore to make for a crowd or brunch, and that could be easily put together ahead of time and\n\t\t\t\tthen baked straight from the freezer when we needed it. We found there was no need to drag out our stand\n\t\t\t\tmixer or food processor for this recipe; mixing the batter by hand actually helped guard against\n\t\t\t\tovermixing, which produces a dense, tough cake. We simply mixed our dry ingredients together in one\n\t\t\t\tbowl, the wet ingredients in another, and then combined the two. Sour cream kept the cake moist and\n\t\t\t\tdelivered just the right amount of richness. For the streusel topping, working the butter into our dry\n\t\t\t\tingredients not only was easy but also delivered bigger, crunchier crumbs than what we would get from a\n\t\t\t\tmixer or food processor. Sticking with just cinnamon and some pecans or walnuts was all the streusel\n\t\t\t\tneeded to complement the cake beneath perfectly. Because the batter was fairly dense, we found it was\n\t\t\t\tbest to divide it between two cake pans to ensure even cooking.",

        "title": "Pecan Sour Cream Coffee Cake",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: We set out to make a Bundt-style\n\t\t\t\tcoffee cake that not only tasted rich and decadent but was also elegant enough for a nice brunch or\n\t\t\t\tfestive holiday morning. And for a cake beyond ordinary, we wanted a swirl of pecan streusel. A\n\t\t\t\thalf-dozen eggs, plus plenty of sour cream and butter, achieved the richness we were after, while ample\n\t\t\t\tbaking powder plus baking soda ensured it was statuesque. For plenty of pecan flavor, we put pecans in\n\t\t\t\tboth the cake and the streusel. Toasting the nuts deepened their flavor, then we ground them very fine\n\t\t\t\tin the food processor since larger pieces would be distracting in the batter and the thin line of\n\t\t\t\tstreusel. Adding a little maple syrup to the batter complemented the nuts perfectly. We poured half of\n\t\t\t\tthe prepared batter into the pan, sprinkled it with the streusel, and then topped it with the remaining\n\t\t\t\tbatter. An orange and cinnamon glaze, drizzled over the cake before serving, was the perfect finish.",
        "serves": "SERVES 12 TO 16",
        "tip": "Use real maple syrup here. For maximum efficiency, toast and grind all of the pecans\n\t\t\t\ttogether, then split between the streusel and the cake. Be careful not to overprocess the nuts or you\n\t\t\t\twill end up making nut butter.",
        "ingredients": "[\"STREUSEL\",\"½  cup pecans, toasted and cooled\",\"3  tablespoons dark brown sugar\",\"1  tablespoon all-purpose flour\",\"1  teaspoon ground cinnamon\"]",
        "instructions": "[\"3. Whisk flour, remaining ground pecans, granulated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in bowl of stand mixer. Using stand mixer fitted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith paddle, beat butter and half of egg mixture into flour mixture on low speed until mixture starts to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome together, about 15 seconds. Scrape down bowl, add remaining egg mixture, and beat on medium speed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil batter is light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed.\",\"4. Add 5 cups batter to Bundt pan and smooth top with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trubber spatula. Sprinkle streusel evenly over batter, then evenly cover with remaining batter and smooth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttop.\",\"5.

        "title": "Applesauce Snack Cake",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Applesauce cakes run the gamut from\n\t\t\t\tdense, chunky fruitcakes to gummy “health” cakes without much flavor. We wanted a moist and tender cake\n\t\t\t\tthat actually tasted like its namesake. It was easy to achieve the looser, more casual crumb that is\n\t\t\t\tbest suited to a rustic snack cake. Since this texture is similar to that of quick breads and muffins,\n\t\t\t\twe used the same technique, mixing the wet ingredients separately and then gently adding the dry\n\t\t\t\tingredients by hand. The harder challenge was to develop more apple flavor; simply adding more\n\t\t\t\tapplesauce made for a gummy cake and fresh apples added too much moisture. But two other sources worked\n\t\t\t\twell. Apple cider, reduced to a syrup, contributed a pleasing sweetness and a slight tang without excess\n\t\t\t\tmoisture. And plumping dried apples in the cider while it was reducing added even more apple taste\n\t\t\t\twithout making the cake chunky. With such great apple flavor, we didn’t want the cake to be too sweet or\n\t\t\t\trich, so we rejected the idea of topping the cake with a glaze or frosting. But we found we liked the\n\t\t\t\tmodicum of textural contrast provided by a simple sprinkling of spiced granulated sugar.",
        "serves": "SERVES 8",
        "tip": "The cake is very moist, so it is best to err on the side of overdone when testing its\n\t\t\t\tdoneness. The test kitchen prefers the rich flavor of cider, but apple juice can be substituted.",
        "ingredients": "[\"¾ cup dried apples, cut into½-inch pieces\",\"1 cup apple cider\",\"1½ cups (7½ ounces)all-purpose flour\",\"1 teaspoon baking soda\",\"2⁄3 cup (42⁄3 ounces) sugar\",\"½ teaspoon ground cinnamon\",\"¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg\",\"1⁄8 teaspoon ground cloves\",\"1 cup unsweetened applesauce, room temperature\",\"1 large egg, room temperature, lightly beaten\",\"½ teaspoon salt\",\"8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled\",\"1 teaspoon vanilla extract\"]",
        "instructions": "[\"1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto 325 degrees.

        "title": "Gingerbread",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Most gingerbread recipes that are\n\t\t\t\tmoist also suffer from a dense, sunken center, and flavors range from barely gingery to addled with\n\t\t\t\tenough spices to make a curry fan cry for mercy. Our ideal gingerbread was moist through and through and\n\t\t\t\tutterly simple. Focusing on flavor first, we bumped up the ginger flavor by using a hefty dose of ground\n\t\t\t\tginger and folded in grated fresh ginger. Cinnamon and fresh-ground pepper helped produce a warm,\n\t\t\t\tcomplex, lingering heat. As for the liquid components, dark stout, gently heated to minimize its\n\t\t\t\tbooziness, had a bittersweet flavor that brought out the caramel undertones of the molasses. Finally,\n\t\t\t\tswapping out the butter for vegetable oil and replacing some of the brown sugar with granulated let the\n\t\t\t\tspice flavors come through. To prevent a sunken center, we looked at our leaveners first. Baking powder\n\t\t\t\tisn’t as effective at leavening if too many other acidic ingredients are present in the batter. In this\n\t\t\t\tcase, we had three: molasses, brown sugar, and stout. Bucking the usual protocol for cakes and\n\t\t\t\tincorporating the baking soda with the wet ingredients instead of the other dry ones helped to\n\t\t\t\tneutralize those acidic ingredients before they get incorporated into the batter and allowed the baking\n\t\t\t\tpowder to do a better job. And while stirring develops flour’s gluten, which is typically the enemy of\n\t\t\t\ttenderness, our batter was so loose that vigorous stirring actually gave our cake the structure\n\t\t\t\tnecessary to further ensure the center didn’t collapse.",
