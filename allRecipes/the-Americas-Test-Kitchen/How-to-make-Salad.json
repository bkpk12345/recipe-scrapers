        "title": "Blue Cheese Dressing",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: We found that the secret to good\n\t\t\t\tblue cheese dressing lay in the creamy components, which we narrowed down to three: mayonnaise to give\n\t\t\t\tthe dressing body, sour cream to supply tang, and buttermilk both to thin out the dressing and to\n\t\t\t\tsupport the sour cream. We also added a little white wine vinegar for zing and just a bit of sugar to\n\t\t\t\ttake off any harsh edge. As for the main ingredient—the cheese—we ruled out really pungent\n\t\t\t\tblue cheeses as too overpowering; a mild blue cheese works best. For the right chunky consistency, we\n\t\t\t\tmixed the crumbled blue cheese with the buttermilk before adding any other ingredients.",
        "serves": "MAKES ¾ CUP",
        "tip": "In a pinch, whole milk may be used in place of buttermilk. The dressing will be a bit\n\t\t\t\tlighter and milder in flavor, but will still taste good. We dressed a variety of different salad greens\n\t\t\t\tand found that delicate ones, such as mesclun and butterhead lettuce, became soggy under the weight of\n\t\t\t\tthe dressing. Sturdy romaine and curly-leaf lettuce were our two favorites. Remember that aggressive\n\t\t\t\tseasoning with salt and pepper is necessary because the dressing will be dispersed over the greens. Use\n\t\t\t\t1 to 2 tablespoons of this dressing per 4 cups of greens, serving two.",

        "title": "Classic Caesar Salad",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For our Caesar salad, we wanted\n\t\t\tcrisp-tender romaine lettuce napped in a creamy, garlicky dressing boasting a pleasing salty undertone, with\n\t\t\tcrunchy, savory croutons strewn throughout. To start, we cut the extra-virgin olive oil in the dressing with\n\t\t\tcanola oil, which made for a less harsh flavor, and we used egg yolks instead of a whole egg to add\n\t\t\trichness. For a robust, though not aggressive, garlic flavor we grated the garlic into a pulp and then\n\t\t\tsteeped it in lemon juice. Incorporating a portion of the Parmesan into the dressing while saving some to\n\t\t\tserve over the salad provided a double layer of cheese flavor. We preferred chewy, crisp ciabatta bread for\n\t\t\tour croutons and tossed them with a little water before frying them in a skillet until crisp. The water\n\t\t\tensured the interiors stay moist and chewy while the exterior crisped. For a flavor boost, we tossed the\n\t\t\tcroutons with a mixture of garlic, olive oil, and Parmesan. Tossed with slices of crisp romaine, our Caesar\n\t\t\tis better than ever.",
        "serves": "SERVES 4 TO 6",
        "tip": "If you can’t find ciabatta, a similar crusty, rustic loaf of bread can be substituted. A\n\t\t\t¼ cup of Egg Beaters may be substituted for the egg yolks. Since anchovy fillets vary in size,\n\t\t\tmore than 6 fillets may be necessary to yield 1 tablespoon of minced anchovies. The easiest way to turn\n\t\t\tgarlic cloves into a paste is to grate them on a rasp-style grater. See “Caesar\n\t\t\t\tSalad” for more details on this recipe.",

        "title": "Greek Salad",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Most versions of Greek salad consist of\n\t\t\ticeberg lettuce, chunks of green pepper, and a few pale wedges of tomato, sparsely dotted with cubes of feta\n\t\t\tand garnished with one forlorn olive of questionable heritage. For our Greek salad, we aimed a little\n\t\t\thigher: We wanted a salad with crisp ingredients and bold flavors, highlighted by briny olives and tangy\n\t\t\tfeta, all blended together with a bright-tasting dressing infused with fresh herbs. For a dressing with\n\t\t\tbalanced flavor, we used a combination of lemon juice and red wine vinegar and added fresh oregano, olive\n\t\t\toil, and a small amount of garlic. We poured the dressing over fresh vegetables, including romaine lettuce,\n\t\t\ttomatoes, onion, and cucumber, as well as other ingredients, including fresh mint and parsley, roasted red\n\t\t\tpeppers, and a generous sprinkling of feta cheese and olives. Marinating the onion and cucumber in the\n\t\t\tvinaigrette tones down the onion’s harshness and flavors the cucumber.",

        "title": "Fresh Spinach Salad",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: With such smooth and flat leaves, baby\n\t\t\tspinach tends to stick together in salad. We knew that we needed a sturdier element to break up the leaves,\n\t\t\tbut we wanted one that wouldn’t overwhelm the spinach. The first step was rethinking our knife work. Thinly\n\t\t\tslicing the vegetables (or at least tearing them into pieces) allowed us to use harder, more crisp produce,\n\t\t\tsuch as carrots. In addition to fluffing up the spinach, carrots provided welcome crunch and sweetness. We\n\t\t\talso reasoned that fresh fruit would add bright, clean flavors and textural appeal. For the dressing, we\n\t\t\taltered the oil-to-acid ratio of our “Foolproof Vinaigrettes” until it was\n\t\t\ttangy enough to bring out the fruit’s natural acidity.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Arugula has a lively, peppery bite and\n\t\t\tso for salad, it’s important to choose accompaniments that can stand up to its assertive character. We found\n\t\t\tthat the sweet and salty notes of fruits and cheeses work well as supporting players to arugula, and crunchy\n\t\t\telements like nuts also provide a nice counterpoint. As for the dressing, a vinaigrette made with mustard\n\t\t\talone turned out to be too spicy, but a spoonful of honey added sweetness, pulling the flavors of the salad\n\t\t\tright in line.",
        "serves": "SERVES 6",
