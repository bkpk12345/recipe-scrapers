        "title": "Butterscotch Pudding",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For butterscotch pudding with rich,\n\t\t\tbittersweet flavor, we made butterscotch sauce by cooking butter, brown and white sugar, corn syrup, lemon\n\t\t\tjuice, and salt together into a dark caramel. We made the process more foolproof by first boiling the\n\t\t\tcaramel to jump-start it and then reducing the heat to a low simmer to provide a large window to take the\n\t\t\ttemperature and stop the cooking at the right moment. To turn our butterscotch into pudding, we ditched the\n\t\t\tclassical (yet time-consuming) tempering method in favor of a revolutionary technique that calls for pouring\n\t\t\tthe boiling caramel sauce directly over the thickening agents (egg yolks and cornstarch thinned with a\n\t\t\tlittle milk). The result is the sophisticated bittersweet flavor of traditional butterscotch with less mess\n\t\t\tand fuss.",

        "tip": "When taking the temperature of the caramel in step 1, tilt the pan and move the thermometer\n\t\t\tback and forth to equalize hot and cool spots. Work quickly when pouring the caramel mixture over the egg\n\t\t\tmixture in step 4 to ensure proper thickening. Serve the pudding with lightly sweetened whipped cream.",
        "ingredients": "[\"12  tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into½-inch pieces\",\"½  cup (3½ ounces) granulated sugar\",\"½  cup packed (3½ ounces) dark brown sugar\",\"¼  cup water\",\"2  tablespoons light corn syrup\",\"1  teaspoon lemon juice\",\"¾  teaspoon salt\",\"1  cup heavy cream\",\"2¼  cups whole milk\",\"4  large egg yolks\",\"¼  cup cornstarch\",\"2  teaspoons vanilla extract\",\"1  teaspoon dark rum\"]",
        "instructions": "[\"1. Bring butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, water,\\n\\t\\t\\tcorn syrup, lemon juice, and salt to boil in large saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally to\\n\\t\\t\\tdissolve sugar and melt butter. Once mixture is at full rolling boil, cook, stirring occasionally, for 5\\n\\t\\t\\tminutes (caramel will register about 240 degrees). Immediately reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer\\n\\t\\t\\t(caramel should maintain steady stream of lazy bubbles—if not, adjust heat accordingly), stirring\\n\\t\\t\\tfrequently, until mixture is color of dark peanut butter, 12 to 16 minutes longer (caramel will register\\n\\t\\t\\tabout 300 degrees and should have slight burnt smell).\",\"2. Remove pan from heat; carefully pour ¼ cup\\n\\t\\t\\tcream into caramel mixture and swirl to incorporate (mixture will bubble and steam); let bubbling subside.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhisk vigorously and scrape corners of pan until mixture is completely smooth, at least 30 seconds. Return\\n\\t\\t\\tpan to medium heat and gradually whisk in remaining ¾ cup cream until smooth. Whisk in 2 cups\\n\\t\\t\\tmilk until mixture is smooth, making sure to scrape corners and edges of pan to remove any remaining bits of\\n\\t\\t\\tcaramel.\",\"3. Meanwhile, microwave remaining ¼ cup milk until\\n\\t\\t\\tsimmering, 30 to 45 seconds. Whisk egg yolks and cornstarch together in large bowl until smooth. Gradually\\n\\t\\t\\twhisk in hot milk until smooth; set aside (do not refrigerate).\",\"4. Return saucepan to medium-high heat and bring mixture\\n\\t\\t\\tto full rolling boil, whisking frequently. Once mixture is boiling rapidly and beginning to climb toward top\\n\\t\\t\\tof pan, immediately pour into bowl with yolk mixture in one motion (do not add gradually). Whisk thoroughly\\n\\t\\t\\tfor 10 to 15 seconds (mixture will thicken after a few seconds). Whisk in vanilla and rum. Place lightly\\n\\t\\t\\tgreased parchment paper against surface of pudding. Refrigerate until cold and set, at least 3 hours. Whisk\\n\\t\\t\\tpudding until smooth before serving.\"]"

        "title": "Chocolate Mousse",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Rich, creamy, and dense, chocolate\n\t\t\tmousse can be delicious but too filling after a few mouthfuls. On the other hand, light and airy mousse\n\t\t\tusually lacks deep chocolate flavor. We wanted chocolate mousse that had both a light, meltingly smooth\n\t\t\ttexture and a substantial chocolate flavor. To start, we addressed the mousse’s dense, heavy texture. Most\n\t\t\trecipes for chocolate mousse contain butter. Could we do without it? We eliminated the butter and found that\n\t\t\tour mousse tasted less heavy. We further lightened the mousse’s texture by reducing the number of egg whites\n\t\t\tand yolks. To make up for the lost volume of the eggs, we whipped the heavy cream to soft peaks before\n\t\t\tadding it to the chocolate. Next we tackled the mousse’s flavor. We maximized the chocolate flavor with a\n\t\t\tcombination of bittersweet chocolate and cocoa powder. And to further deepen the chocolate flavor, we found\n\t\t\tthat a small amount of instant espresso powder, salt, and brandy did the trick.",
        "serves": "SERVES 6 TO 8",
        "tip": "When developing this recipe, we used Callebaut Intense Dark Chocolate and Ghirardelli\n\t\t\tBittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar, which each contain about 60 percent cacao. If you want to use a chocolate\n\t\t\twith a higher percentage of cacao, see our variation, Premium Dark Chocolate Mousse (recipe follows). If you\n\t\t\tchoose to make the mousse a day in advance, let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.\n\t\t\tServe with Whipped Cream (page 709) and chocolate shavings, if desired. See Recipe Tutorial on page 763 for\n\t\t\tmore details on this recipe.",

        "title": "Chocolate Pots de Crème",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Classic pots de crème can be finicky and laborious, requiring a hot water bath\n\t\t\tthat threatens to splash the custards every time the pan is moved. We wanted a user-friendly recipe that\n\t\t\tdelivered a decadent dessert with a satiny texture and intense chocolate flavor. First we moved the dish out\n\t\t\tof the oven, concentrating on an unconventional approach in which the custard is cooked on the stovetop in a\n\t\t\tsaucepan, then poured into ramekins. Our next challenge was developing the right amount of richness and\n\t\t\tbody, which we did by choosing a combination of heavy cream and half-and-half, along with egg yolks only,\n\t\t\tfor maximum richness. For intense chocolate flavor, we focused on bittersweet chocolate—and a lot of\n\t\t\tit. Our chocolate content was at least 50 percent more than in any other recipe we had encountered.",
        "serves": "SERVES 8",
        "tip": "We prefer pots de crème made with 60 percent bittersweet chocolate (our favorite brands are\n\t\t\tGhirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar and Callebaut Intense Dark Chocolate), but 70 percent\n\t\t\tbittersweet chocolate can also be used. If using a 70 percent bittersweet chocolate, reduce the amount of\n\t\t\tchocolate to 8 ounces.",

        "title": "Crème Anglaise",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Crème anglaise is a velvety and\n\t\t\tversatile custard sauce—it tastes great over fresh or baked fruit and with many different cakes and\n\t\t\tother desserts. In pursuit of a rich, creamy, perfectly smooth crème anglaise, we learned that properly\n\t\t\ttempering (raising the temperature of an egg yolk–enriched mixture gradually) the custard was crucial;\n\t\t\tthis prevents the eggs from curdling as they are incorporated into the milk. To do this, we slowly added a\n\t\t\tcup of the hot milk to the yolk mixture to warm the yolks, then poured the mixture back into the saucepan\n\t\t\twith the rest of the hot milk. (The initial addition of the hot milk does the tempering, so that the yolks\n\t\t\tare able to stand the heat of the remaining hot milk.) When adding the hot liquid to the egg yolk mixture,\n\t\t\tit was essential to whisk constantly so that the milk didn’t scramble the egg yolks. Once the yolks were\n\t\t\tadded to the pan, more stirring ensured our crème anglaise had the smoothest texture possible. Straining the\n\t\t\tsauce before chilling it provided further insurance that it would be silky smooth when drizzled over cake,\n\t\t\tfruit, or anything else.",
