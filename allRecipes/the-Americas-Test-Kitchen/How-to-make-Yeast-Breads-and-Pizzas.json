        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Most whole-wheat bread recipes turn\n\t\t\t\tout either squat bricks or white bread in disguise. We wanted a nutty, hearty, light-textured sandwich\n\t\t\t\tloaf that tasted like wheat. We started with a good white-flour recipe and worked our way backward to\n\t\t\t\t“unrefine” it, replacing different amounts of all-purpose flour with whole wheat to find the highest\n\t\t\t\tpercentage of whole-wheat flour that we could use before the texture suffered. To bump the amount of\n\t\t\t\twhole wheat up more, we substituted protein-rich bread flour for the all-purpose flour. We soaked the\n\t\t\t\tflour overnight in milk, with some wheat germ for added flavor, to soften the grain’s fiber, keep the\n\t\t\t\tdough moist, and coax out sweet flavor. For well-developed flavor, we turned to a sponge, a mixture of\n\t\t\t\tflour, water, and yeast left to sit overnight. Adding honey for better flavor and complexity and\n\t\t\t\tswapping some butter for vegetable oil to cut the richness perfected our whole-wheat sandwich bread.",

        "title": "Sticky Buns with Pecans",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Sticky buns are often too sweet,\n\t\t\t\ttoo big, too rich, and just too much. We wanted a bun that was neither dense nor bready, with a crumb\n\t\t\t\tthat was tender and feathery and a gently gooey and chewy glaze. To keep the sticky bun glaze from\n\t\t\t\thardening into a tooth-pulling, taffylike shell, we added cream, which kept the glaze supple. To the\n\t\t\t\tdough’s basic mix of flour, yeast, and salt we added buttermilk, which gave the buns a complex flavor\n\t\t\t\tand a little acidity that balanced the sweetness. Butter and eggs enriched the dough further. After the\n\t\t\t\tfirst rise, we spread the filling—brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and butter—over the dough,\n\t\t\t\trolled it, cut the individual buns, and laid them in the pan with the caramel to rise once more before\n\t\t\t\tbeing baked. We found that setting the pan on a baking stone in the oven ensured that the bottoms of the\n\t\t\t\tbuns (which would end up on top) baked completely. To preserve the crispness of the nuts, we created one\n\t\t\t\tmore layer: toasted nuts in a lightly sweetened glaze to crown the rolls before serving.",

        "title": "Almost No-Knead Bread",
        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: The no-knead method of bread making\n\t\t\t\treplaces kneading, the mechanical process that forms the gluten that gives bread structure, with a very\n\t\t\t\thigh hydration level (85 percent—for every 10 ounces of flour, there are 8.5 ounces of water) and\n\t\t\t\ta 8-to 18-hour autolyse, or resting period, that allows the flour to hydrate and rest before the dough\n\t\t\t\tis briefly kneaded. It is baked in a preheated Dutch oven; the humid environment gives the loaf a\n\t\t\t\tdramatic open crumb structure and crisp crust. However, as we baked loaf after loaf, we found two big\n\t\t\t\tproblems: the dough deflated when carried to the pot, causing misshapen loaves, and it lacked flavor. To\n\t\t\t\tgive the dough more strength, we lowered the hydration and added the bare minimum of kneading time\n\t\t\t\t(under a minute) to compensate. Using a parchment paper sling, we were able to transfer the dough\n\t\t\t\twithout it deflating. For flavor, we introduced two elements that a starter adds to artisan breads: an\n\t\t\t\tacidic tang with vinegar and a shot of yeasty flavor with beer.",

Take note of the knobs on your Dutch oven lid, as not all are ovensafe at\n\t\t\t\t500 degrees; look for inexpensive replacement knobs from the manufacturer of your Dutch oven (or try\n\t\t\t\tusing a metal drawer handle from a hardware store).

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: To make really good olive-rosemary\n\t\t\t\tbread, we needed a great homemade rustic bread—with a coarse crumb, chewy interior, and thick,\n\t\t\t\tburnished crust—and a way to add olives without ruining the bread. We started by simply adding\n\t\t\t\tolives to a plain rustic Italian bread recipe, but the moisture from the olives made the bread gummy,\n\t\t\t\tand the assertive olive flavor made the bread itself seem bland. To compensate, we added some\n\t\t\t\twhole-wheat flour and reduced the hydration level (the weight of the water divided by the weight of the\n\t\t\t\tflour) from 68 to 63 percent. Honey added sweetness and brought out the olives’ savory flavor. Rolling\n\t\t\t\tthe olives up in the dough before the first rise gave us a nicely textured loaf with evenly dispersed\n\t\t\t\tolives. Just about any good brined or oil-cured olives worked well (after a quick rinse to control\n\t\t\t\tsaltiness).

We started with the flour selection;\n\t\t\t\tall-purpose, with less protein than bread flour, produced loaves with a more open, springy texture. We\n\t\t\t\tbuilt flavor through the sponge—as it ferments, the yeast produces lactic and acetic acids, which\n\t\t\t\tgive the bread its characteristic sourness. Kneading on its own produced loaves that spread out instead\n\t\t\t\tof rising, so we turned to a combination of kneading, folding, and letting the dough rest. This process\n\t\t\t\tgave the dough structure but also oversized holes. Adding a small amount of milk slightly weakened the\n\t\t\t\tgluten strands and took down the size of those big bubbles.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: With home ovens that reach only 500\n\t\t\t\tdegrees and dough that’s impossible to stretch thin, even the savviest cooks can struggle to produce New\n\t\t\t\tYork–style parlor-quality pizza. We were in pursuit of a New York–style pizza with a perfect\n\t\t\t\tcrust—thin, crisp, and spottily charred on the exterior; tender yet chewy within. High-protein\n\t\t\t\tbread flour gave us a chewy, nicely tanned pizza crust, and the right ratio of flour, water, and yeast\n\t\t\t\tgave us dough that would stretch and retain moisture as it baked. We kneaded the dough quickly in a food\n\t\t\t\tprocessor then let it proof in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to develop its flavors. After we\n\t\t\t\tshaped and topped the pizza, it went onto a blazing-hot baking stone to cook. Placing the stone near the\n\t\t\t\ttop of the oven was a surprising improvement, allowing the top of the pizza to brown as well as the\n\t\t\t\tbottom. In minutes we had a pizza with everything in sync: a thoroughly crisp, browned crust with a\n\t\t\t\tslightly chewy texture.",

        "tip": "If you don’t have a baking stone, bake the pizzas on an overturned and preheated rimmed\n\t\t\t\tbaking sheet. You can shape the second dough round while the first pizza bakes, but don’t add the\n\t\t\t\ttoppings until just before baking. You will need a pizza peel for this recipe. It is important to use\n\t\t\t\tice water in the dough to prevent it from overheating in the food processor. Semolina flour is ideal for\n\t\t\t\tdusting the peel; use it in place of bread flour if you have it. The sauce will yield more than needed\n\t\t\t\tin the recipe; extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to one week or frozen for up to one month.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Unlike its thin-crust cousin, pan\n\t\t\t\tpizza has a soft, chewy, thick crust that can stand up to substantial toppings. We wanted to try our\n\t\t\t\thand at making this pizza without a lot of fuss. Most of the allure of deep-dish pizza is in the crust,\n\t\t\t\tso it was important to get it right. After trying numerous ingredients and techniques, we found a\n\t\t\t\tsurprising solution: adding boiled potato gave the crust exactly the right qualities. It was soft and\n\t\t\t\tmoist, yet with a bit of chew and good structure. The potato even made the unbaked dough easier to\n\t\t\t\thandle. To keep the outside of the crust from toughening during baking, we added a generous amount of\n\t\t\t\tolive oil to the pan before putting in the dough. Topping the pizza before it went into the oven weighed\n\t\t\t\tdown the crust so that it didn’t rise enough, so we baked the crust untopped for a few minutes first.\n\t\t\t\tOur crust wasn’t just a platform for the topping; it had great flavor and texture of its own.",

We wanted a light, airy loaf, crisp-crusted and topped with a smattering\n\t\t\t\tof herbs. A sponge gave us the flavor benefits of a long fermentation with minimal effort. But our\n\t\t\t\tloaves weren’t tender and airy enough. Thinking that kneading was developing too much gluten, we tried a\n\t\t\t\tgentler approach. A high proportion of water to flour and a long resting process let the natural enzymes\n\t\t\t\tin the wheat replicate the effect of kneading. We shaved an hour off our proofing time by adding the\n\t\t\t\tsalt later in the process, preventing it from slowing down the activity of the enzymes. To give our\n\t\t\t\tloaves a flavorful, crisp crust, we oiled the baking pans and added coarse salt.",
