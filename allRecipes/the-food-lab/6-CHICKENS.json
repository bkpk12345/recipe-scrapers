Meanwhile, heat the oven to highest possible temperature (500° to 550°F).\",\"3.  Ten minutes before your guests are ready to be served, remove the foil, place the roast in the hot oven, and cook until well browned and crisp on the exterior, 6 to 10 minutes.\",\"4.  Remove the roast from the oven and cut off and remove the butcher’s twine if you used it. Remove the slab of bones and slice in between each rib. Set them on a serving platter. Carve the eye of meat into ¼-inch slices and arrange on the serving platter. Serve immediately.\",\"2.  Add the carrot, celery, and onions to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to lightly brown, about 8 minutes. Add the wine, bay leaves, thyme, and parsley and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot, then bring to a boil and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken stock and return the oxtails to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, cover, and cook until the meat is starting to fall off the bones, 3 to 3½ hours.\",\"3.  Using tongs, transfer the oxtails to a large bowl. When they are cool enough to handle, shred the meat from the bones; discard the bones. Transfer the meat to a sealable storage container.\",\"4.  Strain the braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium saucepan. Carefully skim the excess fat from the top with a ladle. Spoon a few tablespoons of the liquid over the shredded meat and season the meat to taste with salt and pepper; cover the meat and liquid and refrigerate until ready to serve. (Reheat the meat in the microwave or in a skillet before serving; see Note above.)\",\"5.  Shortly before serving the roast, return the strained braising liquid to a simmer and cook until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the jus with the prime rib.\"]"

So, when I cook a rack of lamb, unless I’m doing something fancy and involved like beer-cooler sous-vide (see here), I do it pretty much the same way I cook my butter-basted steak (see here): skip the oven completely and roast it in a moderately hot pan on the stovetop.
