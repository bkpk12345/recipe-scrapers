    "serves": "MAKES 2 QUARTS",
    "ingredients": "[\"1 ounce (4 packets; about 3 tablespoons) unflavored gelatin\",\"2 pounds skin-on chicken backs and wing tips, preferably from young chickens\",\"2 pounds chicken legs\",\"1 large onion, roughly chopped\",\"1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped\",\"2 stalks celery, roughly chopped\",\"2 bay leaves\",\"2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns\",\"1 teaspoon fennel seeds\",\"1 teaspoon coriander seeds\",\"6 sprigs fresh parsley\"]",
    "instructions": "[\"1.  Pour 4 cups water into a medium bowl and sprinkle with the gelatin. Set aside until the gelatin is hydrated, about 10 minutes.\",\"2.  Meanwhile, chop the chicken backs and wing tips with a cleaver into rough 2-inch pieces, or cut up with poultry shears. Working in two or three batches, transfer the chicken to a food processor and pulse until the texture roughly approximates ground chicken, stopping if a particularly hard bone gets stuck on the blade.\",\"3.  Transfer the ground chicken, chicken legs, onion, carrot, celery, bay leaves, peppercorns, fennel, coriander, and parsley to a large Dutch oven or stockpot and add cold water to just cover the ingredients, about 2 quarts. Add the hydrated gelatin and water and bring to a boil over high heat. Adjust the heat to maintain a brisk simmer, then skim off any foam and scum from the surface and discard. Cook for 45 minutes, adding water as necessary to keep the ingredients submerged. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.\",\"4.  Using a pair of tongs, transfer the chicken legs to a bowl and set aside to cool. Remove and discard any large pieces of bone and vegetables from the stock. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl and discard the solids. Return the stock to the pot, bring to a rolling simmer, and reduce to 2 quarts, about 10 minutes.\",\"5.  Meanwhile, pick the meat off the chicken legs and reserve for another use (such as Chicken Vegetable Soup or Chicken and Dumplings; see here or here). Discard the bones and skin.\",\"6.  When the stock has finished reducing, allow it to rest until the excess fat and scum form a distinct layer on the surface, about 15 minutes, then skim off with a ladle—discard the fat or save it for another use. Alternatively, you can refrigerate the stock overnight and remove the solid fat from the top. The stock will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or it can be frozen for at least 3 months (see here).\"]"

    "instructions": "[\"I love how the meat shreds under the slightest pressure from your fork. I love the rich onion-scented gravy, studded with flecks of beef debris. I love the tender carrots and potatoes, heavy with meat juices. For soul-satisfying cold-weather fare, it’s about as good as it gets.\",\"You may wonder why many braised recipes call for cooking in the oven instead of simmering on the stovetop. Here’s the deal: a stovetop maintains a constant heat output, while an oven maintains a constant temperature. This means that on the stovetop, the same amount of heat energy is being transferred to the pot no matter how much stuff is inside it, and no matter how hot that stuff already is. A pot of stew that’s barely simmering at the start of cooking over medium-low heat might be at a rapid boil toward the end of cooking, when some of the liquid has evaporated and the volume of the stew has diminished. In an oven, no matter how much or how little food there is in the pot, the temperature of the food remains the same. Moreover, an oven heats gently from all sides, while a burner focuses the heat on the bottom of the pot. Move all your braises to the oven, and you’ll get better results—guaranteed.\",\"1.  Combine the chicken stock (not the meat), carrots, celery, and onion in a large Dutch oven and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.\",\"2.  Meanwhile, make the biscuits: Whisk together the buttermilk and egg in a medium bowl.\",\"3.  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and process until mixed, about 2 seconds. Scatter the butter evenly over the surface of the flour and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal and the largest butter pieces are about ¼ inch at their widest dimension. Transfer to a large bowl, add the buttermilk mixture, and fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. The dough will be a little shaggy and pretty sticky.\",\"4.  Stir the parsley and chicken meat into the stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Using a greased tablespoon measure, drop dumplings onto its surface, leaving a little space between them. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the dumplings have doubled in volume and are cooked through (you can cut one open with a knife to peek, or insert a cake tester or toothpick—it should come out clean).

Tomatoes can taste good in chili. Heck, even pork and tomatillos can taste good in chili. So why shouldn’t we be able to make a completely meatless version that tastes great as well?\",\"The key to rich flavor in vegetable chili is twofold: first, a long simmer during which water is driven off so that flavors are concentrated and various volatile compounds break down and then recombine to add complexity, and second, a good source of glutamic acid, the chemical responsible for the flavor we recognize as savory, sometimes called umami. So, time to reach for the umami bombs again (see here). Anchovies are out of the picture for obvious reasons, but a touch of Marmite and soy sauce adds a ton of richness to the chili. Other than that, the flavor base is pretty straightforward: onions sweated in a little vegetable oil, garlic, oregano (the dried stuff is fine for long-cooking applications like this), and a couple of canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce to add a touch of smokiness and heat, compensating nicely for the lack of browned beef.\",\"1.  Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

Here’s another of my favorite bean-based dishes. Serve it with sliced crusty bread that’s been brushed with olive oil and toasted.\",\"1.  Combine the beans, ham, stock, onion, garlic, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large Dutch oven and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the beans are completely tender, about 45 minutes, adding water as necessary to keep the beans covered. Remove from the heat, remove the ham, and set aside. Discard the onion, garlic, and bay leaves.\",\"2.  When the ham is cool enough to handle, shred the meat into small pieces and return to the pot; discard the bones. Add the kale to the pot, bring to a vigorous simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until some beans have broken down completely, the liquid is reduced to a thick stew-like consistency, and the kale is completely tender, about 30 minutes.\",\"3.  Season the beans to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in shallow bowls, drizzling each one with plenty of extra-virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sherry vinegar. Serve.\"]"
