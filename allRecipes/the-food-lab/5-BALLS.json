    "title": "BASIC HOMEMADE SAUSAGE",
    "serves": "MAKES 1 KILOGRAM (ABOUT 2 POUNDS 3 OUNCES)",
    "ingredients": "[\"1 kilogram (about 2 pounds 3 ounces) pork shoulder with at least 20% fat content, cut into rough 1-inch chunks\",\"15 grams (about 0.5 ounce/1½ tablespoons) kosher salt\",\"Seasoning as desired (recipes follow)\",\"2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper\",\"2 tablespoons fennel seeds\",\"1 teaspoon dried oregano\",\"¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\",\"1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\",\"1 tablespoon red wine vinegar\",\"2 tablespoons red pepper flakes (for hot sausage)\",\"1½ teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg\",\"½ teaspoon ground ginger\",\"1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\",\"½ cup sour cream or crème fraîche\",\"3 tablespoons red wine vinegar\",\"1 tablespoon paprika\",\"½ teaspoon cayenne pepper\",\"¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon\",\"¼ teaspoon ground cloves\",\"1 teaspoon ground cumin\",\"1 teaspoon dried oregano\",\"½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\",\"3 medium cloves garlic, minced or grated on a Microplane (about 1 tablespoon)\",\"3 to 4 tablespoons harissa (or more, depending on how spicy you like it)\",\"1 teaspoon dried oregano or 1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano\",\"2 teaspoon fennel seeds\",\"1 tablespoon sumac (optional; see Note above)\",\"1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\"]",
    "instructions": "[\"1.  Salt and season. Add aromatic flavorings and salt to the chunks of meat and fat. As discussed here, salt is absolutely essential and should be measured out to between 1 and 2 percent of the total weight of the meat and fat.\",\"1.  Combine the meat, salt, and seasonings in a large bowl and toss with clean hands until homogeneous. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, and up to 24 hours.\",\"3.  Uncooked sausage will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator.\",\"2.  Rest. Resting allows time for the salt to break down some of the meat proteins, getting them ready to bind to each other when the meat is ground and blended. A proper rest should be between 12 and 24 hours.\",\"3.  Grind. Pass the rested seasoned meat through a grinder.\",\"4.  Blend. Blend the sausage meat together, preferably in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. This step will help dissolved proteins to cross-link with each other, allowing them to form a sticky matrix (much as gluten develops in kneaded bread dough) that will trap in moisture and fat and give the sausage resilience and bounce.\",\"2.  Place the feed tube, shaft, plates, die, and blade of the grinder in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Then attach the grinder to your mixer and fit it with the ¼-inch die. On medium speed, grind the pork mixture into the mixer bowl. Feed a crumpled paper towel through the grinder to force out any remaining bits of sausage. With the paddle attachment, mix the sausage on medium-low speed until homogeneous and tacky, about 2 minutes. Shape and cook as desired.\",\"2.  Place the processor bowl and blade in the freezer for 15 minutes. Working with 200 grams (about 7 ounces) at a time, place the seasoned pork in the bowl of the food processor and pulse until finely ground, about 15 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat until all the pork is ground. Using clean hands, knead the pork until it is homogeneous and tacky, about 5 minutes. Shape and cook as desired.\"]"

Carefully flip them with a small offset spatula or a fork and cook on the second side until well browned, about 3 to 4 minutes longer. Using tongs, transfer the meatballs to a paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining two batches of meatballs, allowing the oil to return to 350°F before adding each batch. Set the meatballs aside. (Discard the oil or strain and save for another use.)\",\"8.  After the sauce has cooked for 1 hour, add the meatballs and simmer for 10 minutes longer. Season with salt to taste, stir in the basil, and serve, with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (and pasta if desired).\"]"

    "title": "PORK MEATBALLS",
    "serves": "SERVES 4 TO 6",
    "ingredients": "[\"1 pound freshly ground pork shoulder\",\"Kosher salt\",\"¼ cup buttermilk or heavy cream\",\"¼ ounce (1 packet) unflavored gelatin\",\"2 slices high-quality white sandwich bread, crusts removed\",\"1 teaspoon soy sauce\",\"½ teaspoon Marmite\",\"2 anchovy fillets, mashed to a paste with the back of a fork\",\"3 medium cloves garlic, minced or grated on a Microplane (about 1 tablespoon; reserve about 2 teaspoons for the sauce)\",\"1 teaspoon red pepper flakes\",\"1 large egg\",\"1 tablespoon sugar\",\"½ teaspoon ground fennel\",\"Freshly ground black pepper\",\"2 cups vegetable oil\",\"3 tablespoons unsalted butter\",\"8 ounces buttom mushrooms, cleaned and sliced\",\"1 small onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)\",\"Reserved garlic from above\",\"1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\",\"1½ cups homemade or low-sodium canned chicken stock\",\"1 teaspoon soy sauce\",\"½ cup heavy cream\",\"2 teaspoons sugar\",\"Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\",\"1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice\",\"1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves\"]",
    "instructions": "[\"1.  To make the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the ground pork with the salt. Mix thoroughly with your hands, then set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.\",\"2.  Meanwhile, pour the buttermilk into a large bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Allow to hydrate for 10 minutes. Add the bread and allow to soak for 10 minutes, turning the bread occasionally until completely saturated.\",\"3.  After the meat has rested, add the soy sauce, Marmite, anchovy paste, 1 teaspoon of the garlic, the red pepper flakes, egg, sugar, fennel, and pepper to taste to the bowl. Add the bread and buttermilk mixture and mix gently with your hands until well combined; do not overknead. Pull off a teaspoon-sized portion of the mixture, place it on a microwave-safe plate, and microwave it on high power until cooked through, about 15 seconds. Taste for seasoning, and add more salt and pepper to the meat mixture as desired.\",\"4.  Using wet hands, form the mixture into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter (a generous tablespoon per meatballs—you should get roughly 30 meatballs), placing them on a large plate as you go.\",\"5.  Heat the vegetable oil in a 10-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (a meatball should sizzle vigorously when you dip the edge of it into the hot oil). Set aside 4 meatballs and carefully transfer half of the remaining meatballs to the pan. The temperature will drop to around 300°F—adjust the flame to maintain this temperature (the oil should continue to sizzle vigorously but not smoke) and cook until the meatballs are well browned on the first side, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully flip them with a small offset spatula or a fork and cook on the second side until well browned, about 3 to 4 minutes longer. Using tongs, transfer the meatballs to a paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining meatballs, allowing the oil to return to 350°F before adding the second batch. Set the meatballs aside (discard the oil or strain and save for another use).\",\"6.  To make the sauce: Return the skillet to medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of the butter, and heat until the foaming subsides. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they give up their liquid and start to brown, about 8 minutes. Push the mushrooms to one side and add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the center of the skillet. Add the reserved 4 raw meatballs and mash with a wooden spoon, then cook, stirring to break up the meat, until it is no longer pink, about 1 minute.\",\"7.  Add the onions, stir the meat, mushrooms, and onions together, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds. Slowly pour in the chicken stock, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the soy sauce, heavy cream, and sugar, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer.\",\"8.  Add the remaining meatballs to the sauce and cook, stirring and turning them occasionally, until they are cooked through and the sauce has thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, stir in the lemon juice and thyme, and serve.\"]"

    "ingredients": "[\"1 pound freshly ground beef (store-bought or home-ground)\",\"4 soft hamburger buns, preferably Martin’s Potato Sandwich Rolls\",\"2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\",\"Vegetable oil\",\"Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\",\"1 small onion, finely sliced (optional)\",\"4 deli-cut slices American cheese\",\"Toppings as desired\"]",
    "instructions": "[\"1.  Divide the meat into 4 even portions and form into pucks about 2 inches high and 2½ inches wide. Refrigerate until ready to use.\",\"2.  Open the buns but do not split the hinges. Brush lightly with the butter, then toast under a hot broiler or in toaster oven until golden brown, about 1 minute. Set aside.\",\"3.  Using a wadded-up paper towel, rub the inside of a 12-inch heavy-bottomed stainless steel or cast-iron skillet with vegetable oil, then heat over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Season the beef pucks on the top with salt and pepper, then place seasoned side down in the skillet. Using a wide heavy spatula, press down on each one until it is roughly 4 to 4½ inches in diameter and ½ inch thick; it helps to use a second spatula to apply pressure on the first one. Season the tops with salt and pepper. Cook, without moving the burgers, until a golden brown crust develops on the bottom, about 1½ minutes. Use the edge of the spatula to carefully scrape up and flip the patties one at a time, making sure to get all the browned bits. If using onions, add to the tops of the burgers, then cover each with a cheese slice. Continue to cook until the patties are the desired doneness—about 30 seconds longer for medium-rare.\",\"4.  Top the buns and/or patties as desired, transfer the patties to the buns, close the burgers, and serve.\"]"

    "instructions": "[\"TO COOK ON THE GRILL\",\"TO COOK UNDER THE BROILER\",\"1.  Divide the meat into four 8-ounce portions and gently shape each one into a patty 4½ inches wide by approximately ¾ inch thick. Place on a flat surface and create a dimple in the center of each patty by pushing down with three or four fingers: the dimple should be about ¼ inch deep and 3 inches across. Season the burgers generously with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.\",\"2.  Ignite a large chimneyful of charcoal. When the briquettes are coated in gray ash, pour out and spread evenly over one side of the grill. Place the cooking grate in place. Or, if using a gas grill, heat one set of burners to high and leave the others off. Scrape the cooking grate clean.\",\"3.  Place the burgers on the cool side of the grill, as far from the heat as possible, cover, and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the burgers reads 110°F for medium-rare, or 120°F for medium, 10 to 15 minutes.\",\"4.  Uncover the grill and transfer the burgers to the hot side. Cook until the first side is well charred, about 1 minute. Flip the burgers and add the cheese. Continue to cook until the second side of the burgers is charred and the cheese is melted, about 1 minute longer. The center of the burgers should read 130°F for medium-rare, or 140°F for medium. Assemble the burgers, topping them as desired, and serve.\",\"2.  Preheat the broiler to high. Place the patties on a foil-lined broiler pan and position it so that tops of patties are 2½ to 3 inches below the broiler element. Broil until the tops are well browned and beginning to char, about 3 minutes. Flip the patties and broil until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center reads 130°F for medium-rare, or 140°F for medium, about 3 minutes longer.\",\"3.  Top each patty with a slice of cheese and place back under the broiler for about 25 seconds to melt it.
