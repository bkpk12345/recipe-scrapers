    "title": "EXTRA-CRUNCHY SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN",
    "serves": "SERVES 4",
    "ingredients": "[\"2 tablespoons paprika\",\"2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper\",\"2 teaspoons garlic powder\",\"2 teaspoons dried oregano\",\"½ teaspoon cayenne pepper\",\"1 cup buttermilk\",\"1 large egg\",\"Kosher salt\",\"One whole chicken, about 4 pounds, cut into 10 pieces (see “How to Break Down a Chicken,” here) or 3½ pounds bone-in, skin-on breasts, legs, drumsticks, and/or wings\",\"1½ cups all-purpose flour\",\"½ cup cornstarch\",\"1 teaspoon baking powder\",\"4 cups vegetable shortening or peanut oil\"]",
    "instructions": "[\"1.  Combine the paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix thoroughly with a fork.\",\"2.  Whisk the buttermilk, egg, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 tablespoons of the spice mixture in a large bowl. Add the chicken pieces and toss and turn to coat. Transfer the contents of the bowl to a gallon-sized zipper-lock freezer bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to overnight, flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the contents and coat the chicken evenly.\",\"3.  Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 2 teaspoons salt, and the remaining spice mixture in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of the marinade from the zipper-lock bag and work it into the flour with your fingertips. Remove one piece of chicken from the bag, allowing excess buttermilk to drip off, drop the chicken into the flour mixture, and toss to coat. Continue adding chicken pieces to the flour mixture one at a time until they are all in the bowl. Toss the chicken until every piece is thoroughly coated, pressing with your hands to get the flour to adhere in a thick layer.\",\"4.  Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the shortening or oil to 425°F in a 12-inch straight-sided cast-iron chicken fryer or a large wok over medium-high heat. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature, being careful not to let the fat get any hotter.\",\"5.  One piece at a time, transfer the coated chicken to a fine-mesh strainer and shake to remove excess flour. Transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Once all the chicken pieces are coated, place skin side down in the pan. The temperature should drop to 300°F; adjust the heat to maintain the temperature at 300°F for the duration of the cooking. Fry the chicken until it’s a deep golden brown on the first side, about 6 minutes; do not move the chicken or start checking for doneness until it has fried for at least 3 minutes, or you may knock off the coating. Carefully flip the chicken pieces with tongs and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 4 minutes longer.\",\"6.  Transfer the chicken to a clean wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 150°F and the legs register 165°F, 5 to 10 minutes; remove the chicken pieces to a second rack or a paper-towel-lined plate as they reach their final temperature. Season with salt and serve—or, for extra-crunchy fried chicken, go to step 7.\",\"7.  Place the plate of cooked chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, and up to overnight. When ready to serve, reheat the oil to 400°F. Add the chicken pieces and cook, flipping them once halfway through cooking, until completely crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet to drain, then serve immediately.\"]"

Adjust the heat to maintain the temperature at 325°F for the duration of cooking. Fry the steaks without moving them for 2 minutes, then carefully agitate the steaks with a wire-mesh spider, being careful not to knock off any breading, and cook until the bottom is a deep golden brown, about 4 minutes. Carefully flip the steaks and continue to cook until the second side is golden brown, about 3 minutes longer.\",\"8.  Transfer the steaks to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain for 30 seconds, flipping them once, then transfer to a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to the oven to keep warm.

I agree: garlic powder is nothing like real garlic. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have its culinary uses. It’s particularly effective in spice rubs and breadings, where fresh garlic would be difficult to incorporate, due to its texture.\",\"* * You may notice the redness of the center of the chicken. This is not because it is undercooked, but because I cracked the bone when cutting it open, revealing some of the chicken’s red marrow. Occasionally bones may snap or crack on their own, or while you are breaking down the chicken, leaving a few red spots inside the chicken even when it is fully cooked. This should not alarm you.\",\"† † This method is also employed in Cook’s Country magazine’s fried chicken recipe.\",\"‡ ‡ You’ll find that like a stomped Koopa Troopa or that ring of scum around the bathtub, he just keeps popping up, over and over.\",\"§ § I won’t say which one, but you know who you are, Aya.\",\"¶ ¶ Microwaves have a wavelength of from several inches up to a foot.\",\"* * * It’s a brilliant recipe that you should check out, by the way.

According to Harold McGee’s On Food and Cooking, “tempora” means “period of time” and refers to the fasting seasons during which fried fish was consumed in place of meat. These days, the word refers to any battered and fried item cooked in the manner of tempura fish, much like Americans have their “chicken-fried steak”—steak cooked in the manner of fried chicken.\",\"§ § § The popular In-N-Out chain of fast-food hamburgers prepares their French fries in this manner—they are cut, rinsed, fried, and served. As anyone can tell you, despite how great their burgers are, their limp, pale fries leave much to be desired. A second trip to the fryer would do wonders for them.\",\"¶ ¶ ¶ Does this remind anyone else of the razor-blade battles when Schick came out with its four-bladed Quattro to compete with Gilette’s Mach 3, and Gilette responded with a five-bladed razor? When will it all end?!?\",\"1.  Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 400°F. Split the potatoes in half lengthwise. Place one half cut side down on the cutting board and slice into planks ⅓ to ½ inch thick. Repeat with the remaining potato halves.\",\"2.  Place the potatoes and vinegar in a medium saucepan, add 2 quarts water and 2 tablespoons salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil until the potatoes are fully tender but not falling apart, about 10 minutes. Drain, then transfer them to a medium bowl, add the buttermilk, and toss gently to combine (it’s OK if some potatoes break). Allow to sit for 5 minutes.\",\"3.  Meanwhile, add the oil to a rimmed baking sheet and place it in the oven to preheat. Combine the garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and 1 tablespoon salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.\",\"4.  Drain the potatoes and return them to the bowl. Sprinkle half the flour mixture over them and turn a few times. Sprinkle the remaining flour mixture over them and fold gently until all the potatoes are coated. Let them sit in the flour mixture for at least 5 minutes, tossing occasionally, until a thick layer of coating has built up around each plank.\",\"5.  Working in batches, transfer the potatoes to a fine-mesh strainer and shake gently over the sink to remove the excess flour, then transfer to a large bowl.\",\"6.  Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven (the oil should be lightly smoking) and add the potato planks in a single layer. Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake until the bottom side of the potatoes is light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and flip the potatoes using a thin flexible spatula. Return to the oven and continue to bake until both sides are deep golden brown and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Drain on paper towels, season with salt to taste, and serve immediately.\"]"
