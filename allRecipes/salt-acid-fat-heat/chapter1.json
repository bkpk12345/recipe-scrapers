For example, I love broccoli, broccoli rabe, and\\n      Romanesco broccoli (that fractal wonder) in equal measure. But with room for only a handful of recipes in each\\n      section, there was no way I could include one for each variety. And choosing between them felt like choosing a\\n      single album to listen to for the rest of my life:\\n      impossible.\",\"When you’re unsure about what to do with your greens, begin by setting a big pot of water over\\n      high heat. While the water comes to a boil, decide if you’d rather use the greens for \\n        Kuku Sabzi\\n      \\n      , \\n        Pasta alle Vongole\\n      \\n      , Ribollita\\n      (page 275\\n      ), or something entirely different. Line a baking sheet or two with parchment paper and set aside. (If the greens\\n      have tough stems, strip the leaves as directed on page 232\\n      . Save kale, collard, and chard stems and blanch them in separate batch after you cook the leaves.)\",\"The problem persisted: how could I ever convey my fervent love for vegetables and demonstrate\\n      their endless variety in just a few pages? As I compiled list after list of my favorite vegetable recipes, I\\n      realized that nearly all of them involved one of six cooking methods. These are the simplest, most useful methods\\n      for every cook to master.

Pluck a leaf from the pot and taste it.\\n      If it’s tender to the bite, it’s ready. Use a spider or sieve to pull the greens from the water, then spread them\\n      onto the baking sheet in a single layer. Let them cool, grab handfuls of greens and squeeze out the excess water,\\n      then chop them coarsely.\",\"And if you have any greens left, ball them up, then wrap and refrigerate for 2 or 3 days, until\\n      you decide what you’d like to do with them.

To reduce the cooking time, soak them overnight.\",\"I’m a tireless champion of soaking beans in advance.

    "instructions": "[\"Ever since that sauce-making competition at Chez Panisse, I’ve learned dozens and dozens of\\n      different methods for making basic tomato sauce, but the truth of the matter is that all of the\\n      variations—using onion or not, adding basil or oregano, puréeing or milling—offer little more than\\n      personal flourish. You can do it however you like; most important is to use the best-tasting tomatoes and olive\\n      oil you can find, and to get the salt right. Do that, and you’ve got yourself a wonderful blank slate, ready to\\n      use in pasta and pizza, of course, but also in dishes as diverse as shakshuka\\n      , braised Moroccan lamb, Mexican rice, or Provençal fish stew.\",\"Set a large, heavy-bottomed, nonreactive pot over medium-high heat. When the pot is hot, add\\n      just enough olive oil to coat the bottom. When the oil shimmers, add the onions.\",\"Season with salt and reduce the heat to medium, stirring from time to time to prevent burning.\\n      Cook until the onions are soft and translucent, or blond, about 15 minutes. A little browning is fine, but don’t\\n      let the onions burn. If the onions begin to brown too quickly, turn down the heat and add a splash of water.\",\"While the onions cook, slice the garlic, then quarter the tomatoes, if using fresh. If using\\n      canned, pour them into a large, deep bowl and crush with your hands. Swirl about 1\\n      /4\\n      cup of water in one can, then pour it into the second can and swirl, then add into the tomatoes. Set aside.\",\"Once the onions are soft, push them to the outer edges of the pot and add a spoonful of oil into\\n      the center. Add the garlic to the oil. Gently sizzle the garlic until it starts to \\n      give off an aroma, about 20 seconds, and before it begins to brown, add the tomatoes. If using fresh tomatoes, use\\n      a wooden spoon to smash them a bit and encourage the juice to come out. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce to\\n      a simmer. Season with salt and tear in basil leaves or add oregano, if using.\",\"Cook over low heat, stirring the sauce often with a wooden spoon. Scrape the bottom of the pot to\\n      ensure that nothing sticks. If the sauce does start to stick and scorch, then do just the opposite. Don’t stir!\\n      That’ll just mix the burnt taste into the rest of the unaffected sauce. Instead, immediately transfer the sauce to\\n      a new pot without scraping the bottom, and leave the scorched pot to soak in the sink. Take extra care to prevent\\n      the new pot from burning again.\",\"Put a large pot of water on to boil over high heat. Cover with a lid to prevent too much\\n      evaporation.\",\"The sauce will be done when its flavor shifts from raw to cooked, about 25 minutes. Dipping your\\n      spoon into the sauce, you’ll be reminded less of the garden or the farmer’s market and more of a comforting bowl\\n      of pasta. If you’re using canned tomatoes, the shift is subtler: wait for the moment when the tomatoes lose their\\n      tinny taste from the can, which can take closer to 40 minutes. When the tomatoes are cooked, bring the sauce to a\\n      rapid simmer and stir in 3\\n      /4\\n      cup of olive oil. Let it simmer together for a couple of minutes; the pomarola\\n      will transform into a rich sauce as it emulsifies. Remove it from the heat.\",\"Purée the sauce with a stick blender, blender, or food mill, then taste and adjust seasoning. Keep\\n      covered in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze for up to 3 months.

    "instructions": "[\"I learned to make meat sauce, or ragù\\n      , from Benedetta Vitali, the Florentine chef who took me into her kitchen, and her family, when I was twenty-two.\\n      We made a pot of ragù\\n      at her restaurant, Zibibbo, every few days. Like most dishes at the restaurant, it starts with soffritto\\n      , a foundation of finely chopped, deeply browned aromatic vegetables. From Benedetta I learned to dote on my soffritto\\n      , first when I finely minced it with the biggest knife I’d ever seen, and then when I browned it using an\\n      inordinate amount of olive oil. Nothing is as important to the flavor of a ragù\\n      as browning, so take your time with the soffritto\\n      and the meat. After that, it’s just a matter of time before you can sit down to a bowl of pasta that tastes as\\n      magnificent as afternoon sunlight reflecting off a Tuscan hillside.\",\"\\n      Set a large Dutch oven or similar pot over high heat and add enough olive oil to coat the bottom. Crumble the beef\\n      into the pot in walnut-size pieces. Cook, stirring and breaking up the meat with a slotted spoon until it sizzles\\n      and turns golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Do not season the meat yet—salt will draw out water and delay\\n      browning. Use the slotted spoon to transfer the meat to a large bowl, leaving the rendered fat in the pot. Brown\\n      the pork in the same way.\",\"And if mincing all of those vegetables by hand is simply out of the question for you, then go\\n      ahead and use a food processor. Just pulse each vegetable separately in the machine, stopping to push everything\\n      down with a rubber spatula from time to time to make sure you get even pieces. Because the blade of the food\\n      processor will burst open more cells than a knife, vegetables chopped in a machine will turn out much more watery.\\n      Put the celery and onion in a fine sieve and press firmly to drain as much liquid out as you can, then combine\\n      with the carrots and proceed as if you’d done it all by hand. No one will be the wiser.\",\"Add the onions, carrots, and celery—the soffritto\\n      —to the same pot and cook over medium-high heat. The amount of fat should be sufficient to nearly cover the\\n      soffritto\\n      , so add more olive oil as needed, at least another 3\\n      /4\\n      cup. Cook, stirring regularly, until the vegetables are tender and the soffritto\\n      is a deep brown, 25 to 30 minutes. (You can cook the soffritto\\n      in olive oil a day or two in advance, if you like, to break up the time-intensive steps in the recipe. Soffritto\\n      also freezes well for up to 2 months!)\",\"Return the meat to the pot, increase the heat to high, and add the wine. Scrape the bottom of the\\n      pot with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits into the sauce. Add stock or water, milk, the bay leaves,\\n      zests, cinnamon, tomato paste, and Parmesan rind, if using.

Once the milk breaks down and the sauce\\n      starts to look appetizing, between 30 to 40 minutes, start tasting the mixture and adjusting salt, acid,\\n      sweetness, richness, and body. If it needs some acid, add a secret splash of wine. If it seems bland, add tomato\\n      paste to bring it to life and lend sweetness. If it needs to be richer, add a little milk. If the ragù\\n      seems thin, add a generous splash of stock. It’ll reduce as it simmers, leaving behind its gelatin to help thicken\\n      the sauce.\",\"Simmer over the lowest possible heat, skimming off the fat from time to time and stirring often,\\n      until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded, about 1 1\\n      /2\\n      to 2 hours. When you are satisfied that the ragù\\n      is done, use a spoon or ladle to skim off the fat that has risen to the surface and remove the Parmesan rinds, bay\\n      leaves, citrus peels, and cinnamon.

Add a small amount of butter and, tipping the pan with one hand, spoon the melting butter onto the egg\\n      white with the other hand. This bastes the egg so the top and the bottom of the white cook at the same rate, and\\n      the yolk just barely sets.\",\"Slip an uncracked egg into boiling water, and pull it out 9 minutes later.

Fill a large saucepan with at least\\n      2 inches of water, and add a light splash of white wine vinegar, which will gently encourage the egg white to\\n      coagulate. Over medium heat, bring to a brisk simmer. Gently crack each egg into your hand or a slotted spoon,\\n      letting the loosest part of the white slide through your fingers or the slots of the spoon. Gently crack the egg\\n      into a coffee cup or ramekin, and then carefully slip the egg into the pan, right where the bubbles are\\n      originating. If the temperature of the pan drops and bubbles disappear, turn up the heat, but be careful not to\\n      let the water boil because it may break off chunks of white or crack open a yolk.

    "instructions": "[\"The perfect light lunch or appetizer, kuku sabzi\\n      differs from a typical frittata in two important ways. To begin with, the ratio of greens to eggs is heavily\\n      skewed in favor of greens—in fact, I use just enough eggs to bind the greens together. And kuku\\n      isn’t kuku\\n      without a deeply browned crust to provide a textural and flavor contrast to its bright, custardy center. Eat kuku\\n      warm, at room temperature, or cold, with feta cheese, yogurt, or pickles to offer the balance of acidity.\",\"Preheat the oven to 350°F if you do not want to flip your kuku\\n      partway through cooking. (See pages 307\\n      and 308\\n      for more on flipping.)\",\"Washing, chopping, and cooking down all the greens for a kuku\\n      can be overwhelming if you’re not used to staring down a mountain of produce, so feel free to prep the greens a\\n      day in advance.\",\"Strip the chard leaves. Gripping at the base of each stem with one hand, pinch the stem with the\\n      other hand and pull upward to strip the leaf. Repeat with the remaining chard, reserving the stems.\",\"Remove the root and top inch of the leek, then quarter it lengthwise. Cut each quarter into 1\\n      /4\\n      -inch slices, place in a large bowl, and wash vigorously to remove dirt. Drain as much water as possible. Thinly\\n      slice the chard stems, discarding any tough bits at the base. Add to the washed leek and set aside.\",\"Gently heat a 10- or 12-inch cast iron or nonstick frying pan over medium heat and add enough\\n      olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the chard leaves and season with a generous pinch of salt. Cook,\\n      stirring occasionally, until the leaves \\n      are wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the chard from the pan, set aside, and allow to cool.\",\"Return the pan to the stove and heat over a medium flame and add 3 tablespoons butter. When the\\n      butter begins to foam, add the sliced leeks and chard stems, along with a pinch of salt. Cook until tender and\\n      translucent, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir from time to time, and if needed, add a splash of water, reduce the flame, or\\n      cover with a lid or a piece of parchment paper to entrap steam and keep color from developing.\",\"In the meantime, squeeze the cooked chard leaves dry, discard the liquid, then chop them coarsely.\\n      Combine in a large bowl with the cilantro and dill. When the leeks and chard stems are cooked, add them to the\\n      greens. Let the mixture cool a bit, then use your hands to mix everything up evenly.

I usually taste and adjust the mixture for salt at this point, but if you don’t\\n      want to taste raw egg, you can cook up a little test piece of kuku\\n      and adjust the salt if needed.\",\"Wipe out and reheat your pan over medium-high heat—this is an important step to prevent the\\n      kuku\\n      from sticking—and add 3 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil, then stir to combine. When the\\n      butter begins to foam, carefully pack the kuku\\n      mixture into the pan.\",\"To help the kuku\\n      cook evenly, in the first few minutes of cooking, use a rubber spatula to gently pull the edges of the mixture\\n      into the center as they set. After about 2 minutes of this, reduce the heat to medium and let the kuku\\n      continue to cook without touching it. You’ll know the pan is hot enough as long as the oil is gently bubbling up\\n      the sides of the kuku\\n      .\",\"Because this kuku\\n      is so thick, it’ll take a while for the center to set. The key here is not to let the crust burn before the center\\n      sets. Peek at the crust by lifting the kuku\\n      with a rubber spatula, and if it’s getting too dark too soon, reduce the heat. Rotate the pan a quarter turn every\\n      3 or 4 minutes to ensure even browning.\",\"After about 10 minutes, when the mixture is set to the point of no longer running and the bottom\\n      is golden brown, gather all of your courage and prepare to flip the kuku\\n      . First, tip out as much of the cooking fat as you can into a bowl to prevent burning yourself, then flip the\\n      kuku\\n      onto a pizza pan or the back of a cookie sheet, or into another large frying \\n      pan. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil into the hot pan and slide the kuku\\n      back in to cook the second side. Cook for another 10 minutes, rotating the pan every 3 or 4 minutes.\",\"If something goes awry when you try to flip, don’t freak out! It’s only lunch. Just do your best\\n      to flip the kuku\\n      , add a little more oil into the pan, and get it back into the pan in one piece.\",\"If you prefer not to flip, then slip the whole pan into the oven and bake until the center is\\n      fully set, about 10 to 12 minutes. I like to cook it until it is just\\n      set. Check for doneness using a toothpick, or just shake the pan back and forth, looking for a slight jiggle at\\n      the top of the kuku\\n      . When it’s done, carefully flip it out of the pan onto a plate. Blot away the excess oil. Eat warm, at room\\n      temperature, or cold. Kuku\\n      makes for amazing leftovers!\"]",

Starting at the\\n      head end, pull out the bones one by one, tugging at them with your tweezers at the same angle at which they are\\n      lodged in the fish. Once you get the bone out, dip your tweezers in a glass of cold water to release the bone.\\n      When you’ve finished, run your fingers over the fish once more to make sure you’ve gotten all the bones.

Spatchcocking\\n      is the term for removing a bird’s backbone and then splaying it so it lies flat, but I like to think of it as a\\n      way to increase surface area for browning while decreasing cooking time. (It’s also my favorite way to cook\\n      Thanksgiving turkey, cutting down cooking time by nearly half!)\",\"\\n      The day before you plan to cook the chicken, spatchcock it (or ask your butcher to help!). Use heavy-duty kitchen\\n      shears to snip down along both sides of the spine (the underside of the bird) and remove it. You can start from\\n      the tail or neck end, whichever you prefer. Once you’ve removed the spine, reserve it for stock. Remove the\\n      wingtips and reserve them for stock, too.\",\"The second trick is one I stumbled on by mistake at Eccolo, when one of my cooks seasoned a few\\n      chickens and left them uncovered in the walk-in overnight. When I came in the next day, I was annoyed by his\\n      negligence. The constantly circulating air of the walk-in—like that of any refrigerator—had dried out\\n      the chicken skin, and the birds looked scarily fossilized. But I had no choice, so I cooked them anyway. The\\n      dried-out skin cooked up golden and glassy. It was the crispiest roast chicken skin I’d ever seen, even after the\\n      bird had rested.\",\"If you don’t have a chance to season the chicken and let its skin dry out overnight, season it as\\n      early as possible, then pat it dry with a paper towel before you begin to cook it. It’ll help achieve a similar\\n      effect.\",\"Lay the chicken on the cutting board, breast side up. Push down on the breastbone until you hear\\n      the cartilage pop and the bird lies flat. Generously season the bird with salt on both sides. Place it breast side\\n      up into a shallow roasting dish and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.\",\"Pull the bird out of the fridge an hour before you plan to cook it. Preheat the oven to 425°F,\\n      with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven.\",\"Heat a 10- or 12-inch cast iron pan or other skillet over medium-high heat. Add just enough olive\\n      oil to coat the bottom of the pan. As soon as the oil shimmers, place the chicken in the pan, breast side down,\\n      and brown for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden. It’s fine if the bird doesn’t lie completely flat as long as the\\n      breast is in contact with the pan. Flip the bird over (again, it’s fine if it doesn’t lie entirely flat) and slide\\n      the entire cast iron pan into the oven on the prepared rack.

Spicy, crisp, and perfectly seasoned, this fried chicken was a\\n      revelation. Though I begged the cooks for any hints about how they got the crust so crisp and the chicken so\\n      tender, they didn’t reveal anything, so I returned home and started to experiment. After cooking a whole lot of\\n      fried chicken, I found that cracking a couple of eggs into the buttermilk, as well as double-dredging, resulted in\\n      a crust that held up. And while I’m fairly certain the folks at Gus’s don’t use smoked paprika, I’m now addicted\\n      to brushing this sweet-and-smoky spice oil all over the chicken before serving it, so I’m not sure I’ll ever be\\n      able to do it another way.

We needed dinner,\\n      and quick.\",\"As she drove us home, I told her we’d bone out the thighs and season them with salt. Then we’d\\n      cook them in a little olive oil, in a preheated cast iron pan over medium-low heat, skin side down, with another\\n      cast iron pan (or foil-wrapped can of tomatoes) weighing them down. Combining moderate heat with the weight\\n      encourages the fat to render, leaving behind crisp skin and tender meat. It’s dark meat that cooks up as quickly\\n      and easily as white meat. After ten minutes or so, we’d flip the chicken, remove the weight, and let the meat cook\\n      through for two minutes more. Dinner would be ready in twelve minutes flat.\",\"When we got home, we realized she had chicken breasts, not thighs, so we grilled them and made a\\n      salad that night. By the time we were eating dinner and my blood sugar levels had returned to normal, I’d\\n      completely forgotten about the thighs.\",\"Tiffany didn’t. The next night, she sent me a photo: she’d gone to the store, bought thighs, made\\n      the chicken according to the vague description I’d given in our hunger-addled state. With their brown, crisp skins\\n      and tender meat, they looked perfect, and apparently, they tasted perfect, too: after taking a bite, Tiffany’s\\n      husband, Thomas, had declared he wanted to build a conveyor belt of this chicken straight to his mouth.\",\"Thomas is one of my favorite people, so I do my best to make his dreams come true.

That is to say, more expensive cuts of\\n      meat—the ones that are already tender—cook quickly, while more economical, tougher cuts, will need to\\n      be tended to carefully over time.

For more about gentle and intense heat cooking methods, look back to page 156\\n      .\",\"Here’s another proverb for you. Ever heard the term high on the hog\\n      ? Used to denote wealth, it’s derived directly from butcher’s terminology. From Dario Cecchini, the butcher who\\n      took me under his wing in Italy, I learned that until well into the twentieth century, entire Italian families\\n      would live off just a handful of hogs for the whole year. A traveling butcher called a norcino\\n      would come by each winter to slaughter animals and break them down into prime cuts. Then the legs would be turned\\n      to prosciutto, the bellies into pancetta, the scraps into salami. The lard would be rendered, and the\\n      loins—the highest cuts off a hog’s back—would be saved for special occasions.\",\"A few months after I returned to California, I happened upon a copy of The\\n        Taste of Country Cooking\\n      by the great southern chef Edna Lewis, where, she carefully recalls her family’s annual hog harvest. She and her\\n      siblings looked forward to the visit of the itinerant butcher who’d help process the hogs on their family farm\\n      each December. The kids watched as the men carefully smoked the hams, bellies, and loins to preserve them for the\\n      coming months. They’d help the women render the leaf lard for pie, make liver pudding, and turn the scraps into\\n      sausages. As in Italy, so in the American South.

As a cut’s distance from an animal’s hoof or horn increases, so does its innate tenderness—and its\\n      price. Steaks and loins are cut from the least active parts of the animal, and they are the most tender. On the\\n      other hand, meat from legs \\n      and shoulders—cuts such as shanks, brisket, short ribs, or chuck—will always be tougher and less\\n      expensive. They are also often more flavorful.\",\"The grand exception to this rule is ground meat. While butchers generally grind tougher stewing\\n      cuts, the grinding process gives these cuts a head start on the way to tenderness by breaking down their long,\\n      tough fibers. So burgers, meatballs, sausages, and kebabs exist at the intersection of economy and speed, making\\n      them ideal for weeknight dinners.\",\"Speaking of weeknight dinners: use these recipes as basic guides. First, master the techniques,\\n      and then start experimenting with the flavor combinations and the cuts of meat. Except where noted, season your\\n      meat as early as possible. Remember, overnight is best, but any time sitting with salt is better than none. And\\n      for more evenly cooked meat, bring it up to room temperature before cooking.\"]",

He wanted feedback about which of his half dozen heritage breeds\\n      produced the most flavorful and tender meat. While it’s got great flavor, heritage turkey meat can be really tough\\n      and dry. And after cooking scores of turkeys, I figured out my favorite methods for cooking them: braising the\\n      legs for a ragù\\n      , and brining and spit-roasting the breasts to slice for succulent sandwiches. After ordering a sandwich, one\\n      customer told us she realized she’d never before associated turkey sandwiches with turkey flavor!

Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, stirring from time to time.\\n      When the salt and sugar have dissolved, remove from the heat and add 8 cups cold water. Allow the brine to cool to\\n      room temperature. If the turkey tender—the long strip of white meat on the underside of the breast—is\\n      still attached, remove it by pulling it off.

Reduce\\n      the flame to medium-high and brown the breast for 4 to 5 minutes, until the skin starts to take on some color. Use\\n      tongs to flip the breast so it’s skin side up, place the tender in the pan beside the breast, and slip the pan\\n      into the oven, pushing it as far back as it will go.

Continue cooking the breast another 12 to 18 minutes, until it registers 150°F at its\\n      thickest point.

But not all steaks are created equal: different cuts will cook differently\\n      depending on their fat content and the structure of the muscle fibers.\",\"When cooking steak, a few rules apply no matter what cut you’re using. First of all, trim silver\\n      skin, sinew, and excessive fat. Secondly, season any steak in advance to give salt the time it needs to perform\\n      its tenderizing and flavor-enhancing feats. Bring any steak to room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes before\\n      cooking, whatever the method may be.\",\"When grilling, always create various heat zones: glowing hot coals for direct heat, and a cooler,\\n      mostly coal-free spot for indirect heat. If using a gas grill, mimic the same effect with the burners. Don’t leave\\n      grilling meat unattended—as it cooks, and its fat renders, it will drip down and cause flare-ups. When\\n      flames brush the surface of cooking meat, they leave behind awful, gaseous-tasting flavor compounds. So never,\\n      ever cook directly over flame.\",\"If you don’t have a grill, or the weather isn’t conducive to grilling, simulate high-heat grilling\\n      by cooking steak in a blazing-hot cast iron skillet. Preheat the skillet in a 500°F oven for 20 minutes, and then\\n      carefully place it over a burner set to high heat. Cook as directed below, ensuring that you leave plenty of space\\n      between each steak in the pan to allow steam to escape. You might also want to open a window and disable your\\n      smoke alarm before you start. You can simulate indirect-heat cooking by simply preheating your cast iron pan on\\n      the stove and then cooking over a moderate flame.\",\"My two favorite steaks are skirt and rib eye.

Lay out\\n      toppings with an eye toward aesthetics. Alternate different colored plums, apples, tomatoes, or peppers for a\\n      striped pattern, or simply dot an asparagus tart with dollops of seasoned ricotta for contrast.

Resist the urge to add so much water, or mix\\n      for so long, that the dough comes completely together. \\n      Some shaggy bits are fine. If you’re not sure whether or not the dough needs more water, stop the mixer and take a\\n      handful of dough in your palm. Squeeze it hard, then gently try to break it apart.

    "instructions": "[\"Most of the time, the best thing to do with fruit is to find a perfectly ripe piece of it and\\n      enjoy it out of hand. The copious stains running down the front of practically every shirt I own attest to the\\n      fact that I put this view into practice all summer long with berries, nectarines, peaches, plums, melons, and\\n      anything else I can get my hands on. As kitchen scientist Harold McGee says, “all cooked food aspires to the\\n      condition of fruit.” Since I don’t think there’s much you can do to improve upon fruit, I suggest the next best\\n      thing, which is to do as little as possible to it. In addition to tarts and pies, these are my four go-to methods\\n      for showing off the glory of ripe fruit.\",\"\\n      Granita\\n      is Sicilian shaved ice, one of my favorite refreshing desserts, in part because it’s so simple to make. Since it’s\\n      frozen with intermittent rather than constant stirring, the ice crystals that form are much larger and flakier\\n      than those you find in ice cream or gelato. They half melt, half crunch away on the tongue.\\n    \",\"Pour either mixture above—or one of your own devising—into a nonreactive (i.e.,\\n      stainless steel, glass, or ceramic) dish or bowl. The mixture should be at least an inch deep in the dish. Place\\n      in the freezer. After about an hour, begin stirring every once in a while with a fork as time allows. When you\\n      stir, make sure to mix up the more frozen edges and top layer really well with the slushier center. The more\\n      diligently you stir, the finer and more even in texture (less icy) the finished Granita\\n      will be. Freeze the Granita\\n      until frozen throughout, about 8 hours. Stir things up a minimum of three times throughout the freezing process,\\n      then give the Granita\\n      a thorough final scrape right before serving until it’s the texture of shaved ice. Serve with ice cream or a\\n      dollop of \\n        Scented Cream\\n      \\n      , if desired. Store, covered, in the freezer for up to a week.\",\"Precisely because these recipes are so simple, they do require that you start with the tastiest\\n      fruit you can get. Use ripe fruit at the height of its season (or, for the Granita\\n      , frozen fruit, which is frozen at its peak). You won’t regret the extra effort.\",\"Squeeze your own citrus juice (or for a shortcut, buy freshly squeezed juice that comes out of one\\n      of those mesmerizing mechanized juicers at the grocery store). Or juice any ripe or frozen fruit (my favorites are\\n      cherry, strawberry, raspberry, and melon) by blending it with a little water in a food processor or blender, and\\n      then straining out the solids. Make sure to squeeze every last bit of liquid out by pressing hard with a rubber\\n      spatula or the back of a ladle. Almond milk, coconut milk, root beer, coffee, espresso, or red wine will also make\\n      delicious Granita\\n      when you don’t have fruit on hand.\",\"Once you’ve got the juice, sweeten it and balance the acid with lemon or lime\\n      juice—whichever is more appropriate. Keeping in mind that everything tastes less sweet when it’s frozen, add\\n      a little more sugar than you think it needs.\",\"To get you started, here are a couple of basic recipes.

But\\n      all I’d ever wanted was a recipe for a cake that rivaled the moistness of cake mix cakes, yet offered that\\n      fancy-bakery flavor. A few months after I began bussing tables at Chez Panisse, my friend Lori Podraza brought in\\n      a Midnight Cake, topped with Vanilla Cream\\n      , to celebrate another cook’s birthday. Though I’d given up on ever finding my ideal cake, I still took a slice.\\n      Who was I to turn down chocolate cake? One bite and I was sunk. I didn’t know why it was so much better than any\\n      cake I’d ever tasted, nor did I care.

Sometimes, around midnight, when we’re in the middle of cleaning\\n      up, I’ll realize I haven’t eaten properly since breakfast. Looking around, I’m surrounded by pastries. As I’m\\n      invariably hot and sweaty after a long day’s work, the only thing that ever looks good is a little bowl of\\n      chocolate pudding, calling out to me from the glass-doored fridge. I’ll find a spoon, pull out a bowl of pudding,\\n      and taste a spoonful. Creamy and cool, it always hits the spot. One by one, the others will spot me and come over\\n      with their own spoons. Together, we’ll silently finish the bowl and return to cleaning up. We always share just\\n      the one bowl. Somehow, this is one of my favorite parts of the night.
