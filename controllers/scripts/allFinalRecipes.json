But clearly, not much of a cook. While I agree that a pure\\n      heart is an ideal attribute for any cook, it certainly isn’t necessary when making soup (though a clear mind\\n      certainly helps).\",\"Soup is exceptionally easy to make. It’s also economical. But all too often, it becomes an easy\\n      way to clear out the fridge. You must have a reason for every ingredient you choose to add into a soup in order\\n      for it to taste good. Get into the habit of making soup with the fewest—and most flavorful—possible\\n      ingredients, and you’ll find it’s so delicious it might even purify your heart.\",\"Soups fall into three categories—brothy\\n      , chunky\\n      , and smooth\\n      —and each will satisfy a different kind of hunger. Though each type calls for different elements, all soups\\n      start with a flavorful liquid, whether it’s stock, coconut milk, or bean-cooking broth. Master one soup from each\\n      category, then let taste and whimsy guide your clear mind and\\n      your pure heart in making delicious soup.\",\"\\n      Brothy\\n      soups are clear and delicate, perfect for serving as a light meal or appetizer, or to an ailing friend with a\\n      meager appetite. With only three or four ingredients, there isn’t much in a brothy soup to distract the palate\\n      from an inferior broth, so wait to make this kind of soup until you have homemade stock on hand.\\n    \",\"\\n      Chunky\\n      soups, by contrast, are robust and rich. Make a pot of chili or Tuscan bean soup and let it fill and warm you up\\n      all week long. With longer ingredient lists and cooking times, there are more ways to build flavor in a chunky\\n      soup, so here you can start with water if you don’t have homemade stock on hand.\\n    \",\"\\n      Smooth\\n      soups will lie somewhere between brothy\\n      and chunky\\n      on the spectrum from light to hearty, depending on the main ingredient. No matter what vegetable or root you use,\\n      though, the result will be smooth and elegant. Smooth, puréed soups make for delightful dinner party first\\n      courses, or light lunches on warm summer afternoons.\\n    \",\"\\n      The formula for any puréed soup is simple. Start with fresh, flavorful ingredients. Then cook a few yellow onions\\n      through, add the chosen ingredients, and stew everything together for a few minutes. Add enough liquid to cover,\\n      bring it up to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until everything is just tender. (Anticipate the way the\\n      greenest vegetables will fade and brown if even slightly overcooked; pull English pea, asparagus, or spinach soup\\n      off the heat a minute before it’s done, knowing the residual heat will continue to cook it. Add a few ice cubes to\\n      speed up the chilling.) Remove from the heat, purée, and adjust the salt and acid. Then choose your garnish. As\\n      paragons of simplicity, puréed soups eagerly welcome crunchy, creamy, acidic, and rich garnishes alike. Use the\\n      list of variations on page 278\\n      for inspiration.\",\"Pour the egg mixture into the simmering stock in a thin stream while gently stirring the soup with\\n      a fork.

Like most dishes at the restaurant, it starts with soffritto\\n      , a foundation of finely chopped, deeply browned aromatic vegetables. From Benedetta I learned to dote on my soffritto\\n      , first when I finely minced it with the biggest knife I’d ever seen, and then when I browned it using an\\n      inordinate amount of olive oil. Nothing is as important to the flavor of a ragù\\n      as browning, so take your time with the soffritto\\n      and the meat. After that, it’s just a matter of time before you can sit down to a bowl of pasta that tastes as\\n      magnificent as afternoon sunlight reflecting off a Tuscan hillside.\",\"\\n      Set a large Dutch oven or similar pot over high heat and add enough olive oil to coat the bottom. Crumble the beef\\n      into the pot in walnut-size pieces. Cook, stirring and breaking up the meat with a slotted spoon until it sizzles\\n      and turns golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Do not season the meat yet—salt will draw out water and delay\\n      browning. Use the slotted spoon to transfer the meat to a large bowl, leaving the rendered fat in the pot. Brown\\n      the pork in the same way.\",\"And if mincing all of those vegetables by hand is simply out of the question for you, then go\\n      ahead and use a food processor. Just pulse each vegetable separately in the machine, stopping to push everything\\n      down with a rubber spatula from time to time to make sure you get even pieces. Because the blade of the food\\n      processor will burst open more cells than a knife, vegetables chopped in a machine will turn out much more watery.\\n      Put the celery and onion in a fine sieve and press firmly to drain as much liquid out as you can, then combine\\n      with the carrots and proceed as if you’d done it all by hand. No one will be the wiser.\",\"Add the onions, carrots, and celery—the soffritto\\n      —to the same pot and cook over medium-high heat. The amount of fat should be sufficient to nearly cover the\\n      soffritto\\n      , so add more olive oil as needed, at least another 3\\n      /4\\n      cup. Cook, stirring regularly, until the vegetables are tender and the soffritto\\n      is a deep brown, 25 to 30 minutes. (You can cook the soffritto\\n      in olive oil a day or two in advance, if you like, to break up the time-intensive steps in the recipe. Soffritto\\n      also freezes well for up to 2 months!)\",\"Return the meat to the pot, increase the heat to high, and add the wine. Scrape the bottom of the\\n      pot with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits into the sauce.

Once the milk breaks down and the sauce\\n      starts to look appetizing, between 30 to 40 minutes, start tasting the mixture and adjusting salt, acid,\\n      sweetness, richness, and body. If it needs some acid, add a secret splash of wine. If it seems bland, add tomato\\n      paste to bring it to life and lend sweetness. If it needs to be richer, add a little milk. If the ragù\\n      seems thin, add a generous splash of stock. It’ll reduce as it simmers, leaving behind its gelatin to help thicken\\n      the sauce.\",\"Simmer over the lowest possible heat, skimming off the fat from time to time and stirring often,\\n      until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded, about 1 1\\n      /2\\n      to 2 hours.

        "instructions": "[\"Two tricks make this simple recipe the most extraordinary way I know to cook a whole chicken.\\n      First, spatchcocking. Spatchcocking\\n      is the term for removing a bird’s backbone and then splaying it so it lies flat, but I like to think of it as a\\n      way to increase surface area for browning while decreasing cooking time. (It’s also my favorite way to cook\\n      Thanksgiving turkey, cutting down cooking time by nearly half!)\",\"\\n      The day before you plan to cook the chicken, spatchcock it (or ask your butcher to help!). Use heavy-duty kitchen\\n      shears to snip down along both sides of the spine (the underside of the bird) and remove it. You can start from\\n      the tail or neck end, whichever you prefer. Once you’ve removed the spine, reserve it for stock. Remove the\\n      wingtips and reserve them for stock, too.\",\"The second trick is one I stumbled on by mistake at Eccolo, when one of my cooks seasoned a few\\n      chickens and left them uncovered in the walk-in overnight. When I came in the next day, I was annoyed by his\\n      negligence. The constantly circulating air of the walk-in—like that of any refrigerator—had dried out\\n      the chicken skin, and the birds looked scarily fossilized. But I had no choice, so I cooked them anyway. The\\n      dried-out skin cooked up golden and glassy. It was the crispiest roast chicken skin I’d ever seen, even after the\\n      bird had rested.\",\"If you don’t have a chance to season the chicken and let its skin dry out overnight, season it as\\n      early as possible, then pat it dry with a paper towel before you begin to cook it. It’ll help achieve a similar\\n      effect.\",\"Lay the chicken on the cutting board, breast side up. Push down on the breastbone until you hear\\n      the cartilage pop and the bird lies flat. Generously season the bird with salt on both sides. Place it breast side\\n      up into a shallow roasting dish and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.\",\"Pull the bird out of the fridge an hour before you plan to cook it. Preheat the oven to 425°F,\\n      with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven.\",\"Heat a 10- or 12-inch cast iron pan or other skillet over medium-high heat. Add just enough olive\\n      oil to coat the bottom of the pan. As soon as the oil shimmers, place the chicken in the pan, breast side down,\\n      and brown for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden. It’s fine if the bird doesn’t lie completely flat as long as the\\n      breast is in contact with the pan. Flip the bird over (again, it’s fine if it doesn’t lie entirely flat) and slide\\n      the entire cast iron pan into the oven on the prepared rack. Push the pan all the way to the very back of the\\n      oven, with the handle of the pan facing left.\",\"After about 20 minutes, carefully use an oven mitt to rotate the pan 180 degrees so the handle\\n      faces right and return it to the very back of the top rack.\",\"Cook until the chicken is brown all over and the juices run clear when you cut between the leg and\\n      the thigh, about 45 minutes.\",\"Let rest 10 minutes before carving.

Cooking something a hundred times in a single night\\n      with total focus will increase your understanding of it a thousandfold. The most important thing I learned that\\n      night? Pan-fried chicken is all about the clarified butter in which it’s cooked, which lends a well-rounded\\n      richness that you just can’t get from olive oil. Clarifying butter is simple: just melt unsalted butter gently\\n      over sustained low heat. The whey solids will rise to the top of the clear, yellow fat, and the milk proteins will\\n      fall to the bottom. Skim the solids off the top with a fine strainer without agitating the proteins at the bottom.\\n      Carefully strain the remaining butter through cheesecloth or a tea strainer.\",\"Line one baking sheet with parchment paper, and another with paper towels.\",\"Another little tip: if you don’t have time to make your own bread crumbs, use panko, the\\n      Japanese-style bread crumbs, and pulse them a few times in a food processor to get a finer texture.\",\"If the tenders are still attached to the breasts, remove them. Use a sharp knife to remove the bit\\n      of silver skin, or connective tissue, at the top of the underside of each breast.\",\"Place one chicken breast with the underside facing up on the cutting board. Lightly rub one side\\n      of a plastic bag with olive oil and place it, oil side down, on top of the breast.

Repeat with the remaining breasts.\",\"Season the breasts and tenders lightly with salt, and then set up a breading station. Set up three\\n      large, shallow bowls or roasting dishes, one each with the seasoned flour, the beaten eggs, and the bread crumbs.\\n      Mix the Parmesan into the bread crumbs.\",\"\\n      Working like Henry Ford, coat all the breasts and tenders first in flour, then shake off the excess.

When the fat shimmers, add a few bread crumbs to test the temperature of the fat. As\\n      soon as they sizzle readily, place as many chicken breasts as you can fit into the pan in a single layer. There\\n      should be space between each breast, and the fat should come at least halfway up the sides of the chicken to\\n      ensure that the breading cooks evenly.\",\"Cook the breasts over medium-high heat until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, then rotate and flip.\\n      Cook until the second side is evenly brown, remove from the pan, and drain on the sheet lined with paper towels.\\n      (If you’re unsure that the meat is cooked through, poke through the breading with a paring knife and check.

That is to say, more expensive cuts of\\n      meat—the ones that are already tender—cook quickly, while more economical, tougher cuts, will need to\\n      be tended to carefully over time. More expensive, tender cuts will benefit from intense\\n        heat\\n      ; less expensive, tougher cuts appreciate gentle heat\\n      . For more about gentle and intense heat cooking methods, look back to page 156\\n      .\",\"Here’s another proverb for you. Ever heard the term high on the hog\\n      ? Used to denote wealth, it’s derived directly from butcher’s terminology. From Dario Cecchini, the butcher who\\n      took me under his wing in Italy, I learned that until well into the twentieth century, entire Italian families\\n      would live off just a handful of hogs for the whole year. A traveling butcher called a norcino\\n      would come by each winter to slaughter animals and break them down into prime cuts. Then the legs would be turned\\n      to prosciutto, the bellies into pancetta, the scraps into salami. The lard would be rendered, and the\\n      loins—the highest cuts off a hog’s back—would be saved for special occasions.\",\"A few months after I returned to California, I happened upon a copy of The\\n        Taste of Country Cooking\\n      by the great southern chef Edna Lewis, where, she carefully recalls her family’s annual hog harvest. She and her\\n      siblings looked forward to the visit of the itinerant butcher who’d help process the hogs on their family farm\\n      each December. The kids watched as the men carefully smoked the hams, bellies, and loins to preserve them for the\\n      coming months. They’d help the women render the leaf lard for pie, make liver pudding, and turn the scraps into\\n      sausages. As in Italy, so in the American South. I love how this story illustrates the universality of economical\\n      cooking.\",\"Every time I make a decision at the butcher’s counter, a diagram of a flying pig flashes through\\n      my mind. As a cut’s distance from an animal’s hoof or horn increases, so does its innate tenderness—and its\\n      price. Steaks and loins are cut from the least active parts of the animal, and they are the most tender. On the\\n      other hand, meat from legs \\n      and shoulders—cuts such as shanks, brisket, short ribs, or chuck—will always be tougher and less\\n      expensive. They are also often more flavorful.\",\"The grand exception to this rule is ground meat. While butchers generally grind tougher stewing\\n      cuts, the grinding process gives these cuts a head start on the way to tenderness by breaking down their long,\\n      tough fibers. So burgers, meatballs, sausages, and kebabs exist at the intersection of economy and speed, making\\n      them ideal for weeknight dinners.\",\"Speaking of weeknight dinners: use these recipes as basic guides. First, master the techniques,\\n      and then start experimenting with the flavor combinations and the cuts of meat. Except where noted, season your\\n      meat as early as possible. Remember, overnight is best, but any time sitting with salt is better than none. And\\n      for more evenly cooked meat, bring it up to room temperature before cooking.\"]",

(If using more than one color, the pattern becomes 45 degrees color A, 45 degrees color B, 135\\n      degrees color B, 135 degrees color A to achieve stripes.)\",\"To create a pleated crust, fold the outer dough up and over itself at 1 1\\n      /2\\n      -inch-ish intervals while rotating the tart. With each pleat, crimp the dough tightly and push it up against the\\n      outer circle of fruit. For a more rustic look, simply fold the dough over the fruit at regular intervals. Leaving\\n      it on the parchment paper, return the tart to the baking sheet, now on the top side, and refrigerate for 20\\n      minutes.\",\"Preheat the oven to 425°F, and set a rack to the middle position of the oven. Just before baking,\\n      brush the crust generously with heavy cream and sprinkle generously with sugar. Sprinkle some sugar onto the fruit\\n      as well. (Brush savory tarts with a lightly whisked egg and omit the sugar. When working with very juicy fruits,\\n      such as rhubarb or apricots, bake the tart for 15 minutes before sprinkling the fruit with sugar, which will\\n      encourage osmosis and cause it to weep. Give the crust a head start so it can stand up to the fruit.)\",\"Bake on the middle rack of the oven at 425°F for 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 400°F for\\n      another 15 to 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 to 375°F (based on how dark the crust is) and cook until\\n      done, about another 20 minutes. Rotate the tart as it bakes to ensure even browning. If the crust browns too\\n      quickly, loosely place a piece of parchment paper over the tart and continue baking.\",\"\\n      The tart will be done when the fruit is tender, the crust is a deep, golden brown, and you can stick a paring\\n      knife under the tart and lift it off the pan with ease. The underside should also be golden-hued.\",\"Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for 45 minutes before slicing.

        "instructions": "[\"Most of the time, the best thing to do with fruit is to find a perfectly ripe piece of it and\\n      enjoy it out of hand. The copious stains running down the front of practically every shirt I own attest to the\\n      fact that I put this view into practice all summer long with berries, nectarines, peaches, plums, melons, and\\n      anything else I can get my hands on. As kitchen scientist Harold McGee says, “all cooked food aspires to the\\n      condition of fruit.” Since I don’t think there’s much you can do to improve upon fruit, I suggest the next best\\n      thing, which is to do as little as possible to it. In addition to tarts and pies, these are my four go-to methods\\n      for showing off the glory of ripe fruit.\",\"\\n      Granita\\n      is Sicilian shaved ice, one of my favorite refreshing desserts, in part because it’s so simple to make. Since it’s\\n      frozen with intermittent rather than constant stirring, the ice crystals that form are much larger and flakier\\n      than those you find in ice cream or gelato. They half melt, half crunch away on the tongue.\\n    \",\"Pour either mixture above—or one of your own devising—into a nonreactive (i.e.,\\n      stainless steel, glass, or ceramic) dish or bowl. The mixture should be at least an inch deep in the dish. Place\\n      in the freezer. After about an hour, begin stirring every once in a while with a fork as time allows. When you\\n      stir, make sure to mix up the more frozen edges and top layer really well with the slushier center. The more\\n      diligently you stir, the finer and more even in texture (less icy) the finished Granita\\n      will be. Freeze the Granita\\n      until frozen throughout, about 8 hours. Stir things up a minimum of three times throughout the freezing process,\\n      then give the Granita\\n      a thorough final scrape right before serving until it’s the texture of shaved ice. Serve with ice cream or a\\n      dollop of \\n        Scented Cream\\n      \\n      , if desired. Store, covered, in the freezer for up to a week.\",\"Precisely because these recipes are so simple, they do require that you start with the tastiest\\n      fruit you can get. Use ripe fruit at the height of its season (or, for the Granita\\n      , frozen fruit, which is frozen at its peak). You won’t regret the extra effort.\",\"Squeeze your own citrus juice (or for a shortcut, buy freshly squeezed juice that comes out of one\\n      of those mesmerizing mechanized juicers at the grocery store). Or juice any ripe or frozen fruit (my favorites are\\n      cherry, strawberry, raspberry, and melon) by blending it with a little water in a food processor or blender, and\\n      then straining out the solids. Make sure to squeeze every last bit of liquid out by pressing hard with a rubber\\n      spatula or the back of a ladle. Almond milk, coconut milk, root beer, coffee, espresso, or red wine will also make\\n      delicious Granita\\n      when you don’t have fruit on hand.\",\"Once you’ve got the juice, sweeten it and balance the acid with lemon or lime\\n      juice—whichever is more appropriate. Keeping in mind that everything tastes less sweet when it’s frozen, add\\n      a little more sugar than you think it needs.\",\"To get you started, here are a couple of basic recipes.

The first step was to add salt to the uncooked eggs; salt dissolves some of\n\t\t\t\tthe egg proteins so they are unable to bond when cooked, creating more tender curds. Beating the eggs\n\t\t\t\tgently with a fork until thoroughly combined ensured our scramble didn’t turn tough. Half-and-half was\n\t\t\t\tpreferred over milk, producing clean-tasting curds that were both fluffy and stable. To replicate the\n\t\t\t\tricher flavor of farm-fresh eggs, we added extra yolks.

The addition of vinegar to the\n\t\t\t\tcooking water helped to set the eggs quickly, and salting the water seasoned the eggs nicely.

We\n\t\t\t\tstarted by sautéing a shallot in the butter to add flavor. Once the béchamel was finished, we stirred in\n\t\t\t\ta generous amount of Gruyère along with a little dry mustard, nutmeg, salt, and pepper to boost the\n\t\t\t\tflavor of the cheese. We then added the egg yolks to this base before whipping the whites (with a little\n\t\t\t\tcream of tartar for stability) and folding them in last. For an extra shot of cheese, sprinkle the\n\t\t\t\tgreased soufflé dish as well as the top of the soufflé with a little grated Parmesan. Also, after\n\t\t\t\tpouring the batter into the dish, trace a circle in the batter with your finger, about ½ inch from the\n\t\t\t\tedge of the dish.

Chicken broth (or tangerine or orange juice, a good choice for shrimp stir-fries in particular)\n\t\t\t\tmade the best base since the flavor was not overpowering. Soy, hoisin, oyster, and black bean sauces, as\n\t\t\t\twell as toasted sesame oil, all proved excellent flavor enhancers. Adding a little cornstarch ensured\n\t\t\t\tthe sauce could cling to the protein and vegetables, but we were careful not to go overboard to avoid\n\t\t\t\tcreating a gloppy sauce. We made sure to whisk together our sauce before we started cooking, and after\n\t\t\t\tstir-frying the protein, vegetables, and aromatics, we added our sauce to the pan and gave it just a\n\t\t\t\tlittle time to thicken up and coat the ingredients before our stir-fry was ready to serve.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: To update boeuf à la mode while maintaining its status as an elegant dish that\n\t\t\t\ttakes the simple pot roast to a new level, we eliminated the fussy step of larding the beef, which\n\t\t\t\tinvolves inserting strips of fat into the meat. Instead we salted the meat and browned it in bacon\n\t\t\t\tdrippings to add a little smoky flavor. Reducing the wine before adding it to the braising liquid\n\t\t\t\tmaximized its complex fruit flavors and minimized sourness and astringency. This step also eliminated\n\t\t\t\tthe need for a marinade. Since the braising liquid is used for the final sauce, we balanced the wine\n\t\t\t\tflavor by adding sautéed onion and garlic and large chunks of carrots. Our final challenge in updating\n\t\t\t\tthe French-style pot roast was to achieve the proper consistency, which we managed to do not with pork\n\t\t\t\ttrotters and split calves’ feet, as is tradition, but by adding gelatin after the sauce had finished\n\t\t\t\treducing.",

Not\n\t\t\tsurprisingly, the classic method of sautéing the meat, then using the browned bits left behind as a flavor\n\t\t\tbase for the sauce, was the way to go.

First, we\n\t\t\t\tswapped out the saucepan for a Dutch oven, which has a thick, heavy bottom, deep sides, and\n\t\t\t\ttight-fitting lid—perfect for trapping and distributing heat as evenly as possible. Typical\n\t\t\t\trecipes dictate adding the broth in small increments after the wine has been absorbed (and stirring\n\t\t\t\tconstantly after each addition), but we added most of the broth at once and covered the pan, allowing\n\t\t\t\tthe rice to simmer until almost all the broth had been absorbed (stirring just twice). After adding the\n\t\t\t\tsecond and final addition of broth, we stirred the pot to ensure the bottom didn’t cook more quickly\n\t\t\t\tthan the top and turned off the heat. Without sitting over a direct flame, the sauce turned out\n\t\t\t\tperfectly creamy and the rice was thickened, velvety, and just barely chewy. To finish, we simply\n\t\t\t\tstirred in butter, herbs, and a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavors.",

We wanted a risotto primavera with fresh yet complex flavors and\n\t\t\t\tvegetables that retained some bite. We started with the classic combination of asparagus and leeks. The\n\t\t\t\tleeks melted down beautifully as their delicate flavor infused the rice. The asparagus had to be handled\n\t\t\t\tseparately; sautéing the trimmed spears and stirring them into the rice right before serving kept them\n\t\t\t\tfrom turning into mush. For a third vegetable, we added frozen peas. For a stronger backbone of flavor,\n\t\t\t\twe simmered the leek greens and tough stems of the asparagus in the chicken broth we used for cooking\n\t\t\t\tthe rice.

We quickly learned we needed thick fillets;\n\t\t\t\tskinnier pieces overcooked by the time they achieved a serious sear. We then turned to a common\n\t\t\t\trestaurant method to cook the fish: We seared the fillets in a hot pan, flipped them, then transferred\n\t\t\t\tthe pan to a hot oven to finish cooking. Sprinkling the fillets with sugar accelerated browning on the\n\t\t\t\tstovetop, shortening the cooking time and thus ensuring the fish didn’t dry out. After a short stay in\n\t\t\t\tthe oven to finish cooking through, the fish emerged well browned, tender and moist, and best of all,\n\t\t\t\tnot one taster detected any out-of-place sweetness.",

The problem is that braising doesn’t allow for browning, which adds great flavor to\n\t\t\t\tfish. We didn’t want to make any compromises on either texture or flavor, so we set out to develop a\n\t\t\t\ttechnique for cooking halibut that would produce perfectly cooked, moist, and tender fish with good\n\t\t\t\tbrowning. A combination of pan searing and oven roasting proved best. To be sure the steaks wouldn’t\n\t\t\t\tovercook, we seared them on one side in a piping hot skillet, then turned them over before placing them\n\t\t\t\tin the oven to finish cooking through. When they were done, the steaks were browned but still moist\n\t\t\t\tinside. To complement the lean fish, we developed a couple of flavored butters and a bright vinaigrette.",

Russet potatoes\n\t\t\t\tturned out to be the best choice, but because they are starchy, we found it was important to rinse the\n\t\t\t\tstarch off the surface after cutting the potatoes. Refrigerating the potatoes for at least 30 minutes in\n\t\t\t\twater made lighter, crispier fries and improved their browning. Coating the fries in a little cornstarch\n\t\t\t\tprior to cooking absorbed some of the surface moisture on the potatoes and created a protective sheath\n\t\t\t\tthat turned into a shatteringly crisp crust once fried.

We wanted to figure out a way to make\n\t\t\t\tcooking this potentially delicious cut of meat less daunting and less time-consuming and we wanted to\n\t\t\t\ttrade in a specialized smoker for a backyard grill.

To get a good crust, we added a little\n\t\t\t\tsugar to the salt and pepper rub. Our “aha!” moment came when we realized that fire can burn down as\n\t\t\t\twell as up. We layered unlit briquettes on the bottom of our grill and added 4 quarts of hot coals on\n\t\t\t\ttop. The result?

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Shrimp can turn from moist and\n\t\t\t\tjuicy to rubbery and dry in the blink of an eye—especially when grilled. While grilling shrimp in\n\t\t\t\ttheir shells can shield them from the coals’ scorching heat, any seasonings are stripped off along with\n\t\t\t\tthe shells when it’s time to eat. For tender, juicy, boldly seasoned grilled shrimp we decided to go\n\t\t\t\twith peeled shrimp and find a way to prevent them from drying out. We seasoned the shrimp with salt,\n\t\t\t\tpepper, and sugar (to help browning) and set them over a very hot fire. This worked well with jumbo\n\t\t\t\tshrimp, but smaller shrimp overcooked before charring. Because jumbo shrimp cost as much as $25 per\n\t\t\t\tpound, we wanted a less expensive solution. We created faux jumbo shrimp by cramming a skewer with\n\t\t\t\tseveral normal-size shrimp pressed tightly together. Our final step was to take the shrimp off the fire\n\t\t\t\tbefore they were completely cooked (but after they had picked up attractive grill marks).

We wanted a moist and tender cake\n\t\t\t\tthat actually tasted like its namesake. It was easy to achieve the looser, more casual crumb that is\n\t\t\t\tbest suited to a rustic snack cake. Since this texture is similar to that of quick breads and muffins,\n\t\t\t\twe used the same technique, mixing the wet ingredients separately and then gently adding the dry\n\t\t\t\tingredients by hand. The harder challenge was to develop more apple flavor; simply adding more\n\t\t\t\tapplesauce made for a gummy cake and fresh apples added too much moisture. But two other sources worked\n\t\t\t\twell. Apple cider, reduced to a syrup, contributed a pleasing sweetness and a slight tang without excess\n\t\t\t\tmoisture. And plumping dried apples in the cider while it was reducing added even more apple taste\n\t\t\t\twithout making the cake chunky. With such great apple flavor, we didn’t want the cake to be too sweet or\n\t\t\t\trich, so we rejected the idea of topping the cake with a glaze or frosting.

Our ideal gingerbread was moist through and through and\n\t\t\t\tutterly simple. Focusing on flavor first, we bumped up the ginger flavor by using a hefty dose of ground\n\t\t\t\tginger and folded in grated fresh ginger. Cinnamon and fresh-ground pepper helped produce a warm,\n\t\t\t\tcomplex, lingering heat. As for the liquid components, dark stout, gently heated to minimize its\n\t\t\t\tbooziness, had a bittersweet flavor that brought out the caramel undertones of the molasses. Finally,\n\t\t\t\tswapping out the butter for vegetable oil and replacing some of the brown sugar with granulated let the\n\t\t\t\tspice flavors come through. To prevent a sunken center, we looked at our leaveners first. Baking powder\n\t\t\t\tisn’t as effective at leavening if too many other acidic ingredients are present in the batter. In this\n\t\t\t\tcase, we had three: molasses, brown sugar, and stout. Bucking the usual protocol for cakes and\n\t\t\t\tincorporating the baking soda with the wet ingredients instead of the other dry ones helped to\n\t\t\t\tneutralize those acidic ingredients before they get incorporated into the batter and allowed the baking\n\t\t\t\tpowder to do a better job. And while stirring develops flour’s gluten, which is typically the enemy of\n\t\t\t\ttenderness, our batter was so loose that vigorous stirring actually gave our cake the structure\n\t\t\t\tnecessary to further ensure the center didn’t collapse.",

We scaled back the\n\t\t\tchocolate until we eliminated it entirely, which made the cookies less cakey and tender, and thus, more\n\t\t\tcookielike. To restore chocolate flavor without adding too much fat, we increased the cocoa powder and\n\t\t\treduced the flour. Using an egg white rather than a whole egg (or yolk) gave us the structure we wanted.\n\t\t\tAdding dark corn syrup gave the cookies a nice chewiness and lent a hint of caramel flavor.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Recipes for peanut butter cookies tend\n\t\t\tto fall into one of two categories: sweet and chewy with a mild peanut flavor, or sandy and crumbly with a\n\t\t\tstrong peanut flavor. We, of course, wanted the best of both worlds—cookies that were crisp on the\n\t\t\tedges and chewy in the center, with lots of peanut flavor. First off, we had to determine the amount and\n\t\t\ttype of sugar. Granulated sugar was necessary for crisp edges and chewy centers, while dark brown sugar\n\t\t\tenriched the peanut flavor. As for flour, too little resulted in an oily cookie, whereas too much made for\n\t\t\tdry cookies. Baking soda contributed to browning and amplified the peanut flavor and baking powder provided\n\t\t\tlift, making both leaveners necessary. Extra-crunchy peanut butter also helped the cookies rise and achieve\n\t\t\ta crispier edge and a softer center. But the best way to get the true peanut flavor we sought was to use\n\t\t\tpeanuts and salt. Adding some roasted salted peanuts, ground in a food processor, and then adding still more\n\t\t\tsalt (directly to the batter as well as in the form of salted rather than unsalted butter) produced a strong\n\t\t\troasted nut flavor without sacrificing anything in terms of texture.",

While eggs are not traditional, we found that\n\t\t\t\ta single egg gave our biscuits a light, tender texture. And we used just enough dairy (half-and-half or\n\t\t\t\tmilk) to bind the dough together. A modest amount of sugar yielded slightly sweet biscuits. For the\n\t\t\t\tstrawberries, we wanted to avoid both a mushy puree and dry chunks of fruit.

During or after baking, the\n\t\t\t\tpastry is broken and pushed into the filling—a technique known as “dowdying.” We found the idea of\n\t\t\t\tan easier approach to apple pie very appealing—no fussy crimping and only one piece of pastry\n\t\t\t\tdough to roll out—so we set out to make our own version. For a juicy apple filling with bright\n\t\t\t\tfruit flavor, we added cider to the apples and sweetened them with maple syrup, both of which made for a\n\t\t\t\tpleasantly saucy filling. Parcooking the apples in a skillet until caramelized before adding the other\n\t\t\t\tingredients helped to deepen their flavor. For the crust, we cut a standard pie crust into squares after\n\t\t\t\trolling it over the fruit right in the skillet—this encouraged a multitude of crisp edges that\n\t\t\t\tcontrasted nicely with the tender fruit and recalled (in a less dowdy way) the broken-up crusts of a\n\t\t\t\ttraditional pandowdy.",

We were seeking a pavlova made of pure white, perfectly crisped meringue, its texture softened\n\t\t\tby whipped cream and its sweetness balanced by a fresh fruit topping. First, we opted to take a restaurant\n\t\t\tapproach and make individual pavlovas for tidier presentation. Then we focused on making and baking the\n\t\t\tmeringue. Whipping room-temperature egg whites with a small amount of cream of tartar and vanilla before\n\t\t\tslowly adding the sugar gave us a voluminous, billowy, stable meringue. To shape the meringues, we portioned\n\t\t\t½ cup of the mixture into small mounds on a baking sheet, then used the back of a spoon to\n\t\t\tcreate indentations for holding the whipped cream and fruit. Baking the meringues at 200 degrees for an hour\n\t\t\tand a half yielded perfectly dry, crisp, white shells. Gradually cooling them in the turned-off oven ensured\n\t\t\ttheir crispness. While we especially liked the flavors of tropical fruit on the pavlovas, fresh berries and\n\t\t\tpeaches made fine options too.

To ensure pieces of butter that were\n\t\t\t\tthe same size each time, we processed a portion of the flour with the fat until we had a unified paste.\n\t\t\t\tThen we added the reserved flour and pulsed until it was just evenly distributed. In order to roll\n\t\t\t\teasily, dough needs a generous amount of water, but too much water makes crusts tough. We found the\n\t\t\t\tanswer in the liquor cabinet: vodka.

Starting with traditional recipes, we increased the amounts of sugar and butter to\n\t\t\tadd sweetness and richness; a combination of whole milk and sour cream lent more richness and tang. For\n\t\t\tlightness, we borrowed a technique from puff pastry, where the dough is turned, rolled, and folded multiple\n\t\t\ttimes to create layers that are forced apart by steam when baked. To ensure that the butter would stay as\n\t\t\tcold and solid as possible while baking, we froze it and grated it into the dry ingredients using a coarse\n\t\t\tgrater. Adding the blueberries to the dry ingredients meant they got mashed when we mixed the dough, but\n\t\t\twhen we added them to the already-mixed dough, we ruined our pockets of butter.

We wanted blueberry muffins that put the berry flavor at the forefront and would\n\t\t\ttaste great even with watery supermarket berries. When we combined blueberry jam with fresh supermarket\n\t\t\tblueberries, the muffins baked up with a pretty blue filling, but the jam made them too sweet. Instead, we\n\t\t\tmade our own low-sugar jam by simmering fresh blueberries with a bit of sugar. Adding our jam to the batter\n\t\t\talong with fresh, uncooked berries gave our muffins intense blueberry flavor and the liquid burst that only\n\t\t\tfresh berries could provide. As for the muffin base, we found that the quick-bread method—whisking\n\t\t\ttogether eggs and sugar before adding milk and melted butter, then gently folding in the dry\n\t\t\tingredients—produced a hearty, substantial crumb that could support a generous amount of fruit. An\n\t\t\tequal amount of butter and oil created just the right buttery flavor and moist, tender texture. To make the\n\t\t\tmuffins even richer, we swapped the whole milk for buttermilk.

We started with a good white-flour recipe and worked our way backward to\n\t\t\t\t“unrefine” it, replacing different amounts of all-purpose flour with whole wheat to find the highest\n\t\t\t\tpercentage of whole-wheat flour that we could use before the texture suffered. To bump the amount of\n\t\t\t\twhole wheat up more, we substituted protein-rich bread flour for the all-purpose flour. We soaked the\n\t\t\t\tflour overnight in milk, with some wheat germ for added flavor, to soften the grain’s fiber, keep the\n\t\t\t\tdough moist, and coax out sweet flavor. For well-developed flavor, we turned to a sponge, a mixture of\n\t\t\t\tflour, water, and yeast left to sit overnight. Adding honey for better flavor and complexity and\n\t\t\t\tswapping some butter for vegetable oil to cut the richness perfected our whole-wheat sandwich bread.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: The no-knead method of bread making\n\t\t\t\treplaces kneading, the mechanical process that forms the gluten that gives bread structure, with a very\n\t\t\t\thigh hydration level (85 percent—for every 10 ounces of flour, there are 8.5 ounces of water) and\n\t\t\t\ta 8-to 18-hour autolyse, or resting period, that allows the flour to hydrate and rest before the dough\n\t\t\t\tis briefly kneaded. It is baked in a preheated Dutch oven; the humid environment gives the loaf a\n\t\t\t\tdramatic open crumb structure and crisp crust. However, as we baked loaf after loaf, we found two big\n\t\t\t\tproblems: the dough deflated when carried to the pot, causing misshapen loaves, and it lacked flavor. To\n\t\t\t\tgive the dough more strength, we lowered the hydration and added the bare minimum of kneading time\n\t\t\t\t(under a minute) to compensate. Using a parchment paper sling, we were able to transfer the dough\n\t\t\t\twithout it deflating.

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: With home ovens that reach only 500\n\t\t\t\tdegrees and dough that’s impossible to stretch thin, even the savviest cooks can struggle to produce New\n\t\t\t\tYork–style parlor-quality pizza. We were in pursuit of a New York–style pizza with a perfect\n\t\t\t\tcrust—thin, crisp, and spottily charred on the exterior; tender yet chewy within. High-protein\n\t\t\t\tbread flour gave us a chewy, nicely tanned pizza crust, and the right ratio of flour, water, and yeast\n\t\t\t\tgave us dough that would stretch and retain moisture as it baked. We kneaded the dough quickly in a food\n\t\t\t\tprocessor then let it proof in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to develop its flavors. After we\n\t\t\t\tshaped and topped the pizza, it went onto a blazing-hot baking stone to cook. Placing the stone near the\n\t\t\t\ttop of the oven was a surprising improvement, allowing the top of the pizza to brown as well as the\n\t\t\t\tbottom. In minutes we had a pizza with everything in sync: a thoroughly crisp, browned crust with a\n\t\t\t\tslightly chewy texture.",

        "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Unlike its thin-crust cousin, pan\n\t\t\t\tpizza has a soft, chewy, thick crust that can stand up to substantial toppings. We wanted to try our\n\t\t\t\thand at making this pizza without a lot of fuss. Most of the allure of deep-dish pizza is in the crust,\n\t\t\t\tso it was important to get it right. After trying numerous ingredients and techniques, we found a\n\t\t\t\tsurprising solution: adding boiled potato gave the crust exactly the right qualities. It was soft and\n\t\t\t\tmoist, yet with a bit of chew and good structure. The potato even made the unbaked dough easier to\n\t\t\t\thandle. To keep the outside of the crust from toughening during baking, we added a generous amount of\n\t\t\t\tolive oil to the pan before putting in the dough. Topping the pizza before it went into the oven weighed\n\t\t\t\tdown the crust so that it didn’t rise enough, so we baked the crust untopped for a few minutes first.\n\t\t\t\tOur crust wasn’t just a platform for the topping; it had great flavor and texture of its own.",

        "title": "BUTTERMILK PANCAKES",
        "ingredients": "[]",
        "instructions": "[\"Apart from its starch content, bread is basically just a ball of protein filled with gas (very much like my dog, in that respect)†. When flour is mixed with liquid, two proteins naturally present in wheat, glutenin and gliadin, link together to form the resilient, stretchy protein matrix known as gluten. In leavened breads, air bubbles are formed in this matrix and expand, creating the familiar hole structure inside a loaf of bread (or a good pizza crust, for that matter).\",\"The most interesting side effect of using baking soda in a recipe is that it affects browning in a major way. The Maillard reaction, named after Louise Camille Maillard, who first described its processes in the early twentieth century, is the set of reactions responsible for that beautiful brown crust on your steak and the deep color of a good loaf of bread. Aside from cosmetics, the reaction also produces hundreds of aromatic compounds that add an inimitable savoriness and complexity to foods.\",\"If there’s one major drawback with chemically leavened breads, it’s that they need to be cooked pretty much immediately after the batter is mixed. Unlike a yeasted bread dough, which is low in moisture and kneaded until a tough, elastic gluten network forms to trap the massive amounts of carbon dioxide produced, a quick bread must be made with an extremely moist batter—baking powder simply doesn’t produce enough gas to effectively leaven a thicker dough. Batters have relatively little gluten formation, meaning that they aren’t all that great at trapping and holding bubbles. Once you mix a batter, your baking soda or baking powder immediately begins producing gas, and that gas almost immediately being trying to escape into the air. When working with quick breads, those who aren’t into the whole brevity thing may run into difficulties.\",\"So what if baking soda just isn’t doing enough for you? How do you get your pancakes to stand even taller and lighter? I like to use a meringue—egg whites that have been whipped vigorously until they form a semisolid foam. Here’s how it works:\",\"As far as flavoring buttermilk pancakes go, there are a few givens: Dairy fat, in the form of melted butter or milk, is essential. Not only does it add richness and flavor to the mix, but by coating the flour and limiting gluten development, it also ensures that your pancakes remain tender. Eggs help set the pancakes as they cook, as well as providing some extra lift. Buttermilk is obviously part of the equation, but I like my pancakes extra-tangy, and straight-up buttermilk just doesn’t cut it for me. Increasing the quantity doesn’t work—that just ends up throwing the liquid-to-solid ratio out of whack. Instead, I replace part of the buttermilk with a good amount of sour cream. It’s both less moist than buttermilk and more sour, which allows me to add acidity without watering down the batter. If you don’t have sour cream on hand, don’t worry—the pancakes will still taste just fine with straight-up buttermilk.\"]",

I love the tender carrots and potatoes, heavy with meat juices. For soul-satisfying cold-weather fare, it’s about as good as it gets.\",\"You may wonder why many braised recipes call for cooking in the oven instead of simmering on the stovetop. Here’s the deal: a stovetop maintains a constant heat output, while an oven maintains a constant temperature. This means that on the stovetop, the same amount of heat energy is being transferred to the pot no matter how much stuff is inside it, and no matter how hot that stuff already is. A pot of stew that’s barely simmering at the start of cooking over medium-low heat might be at a rapid boil toward the end of cooking, when some of the liquid has evaporated and the volume of the stew has diminished. In an oven, no matter how much or how little food there is in the pot, the temperature of the food remains the same. Moreover, an oven heats gently from all sides, while a burner focuses the heat on the bottom of the pot. Move all your braises to the oven, and you’ll get better results—guaranteed.\",\"1.  Combine the chicken stock (not the meat), carrots, celery, and onion in a large Dutch oven and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.\",\"2.  Meanwhile, make the biscuits: Whisk together the buttermilk and egg in a medium bowl.\",\"3.  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and process until mixed, about 2 seconds. Scatter the butter evenly over the surface of the flour and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal and the largest butter pieces are about ¼ inch at their widest dimension. Transfer to a large bowl, add the buttermilk mixture, and fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. The dough will be a little shaggy and pretty sticky.\",\"4.  Stir the parsley and chicken meat into the stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Using a greased tablespoon measure, drop dumplings onto its surface, leaving a little space between them. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the dumplings have doubled in volume and are cooked through (you can cut one open with a knife to peek, or insert a cake tester or toothpick—it should come out clean).

So, time to reach for the umami bombs again (see here). Anchovies are out of the picture for obvious reasons, but a touch of Marmite and soy sauce adds a ton of richness to the chili. Other than that, the flavor base is pretty straightforward: onions sweated in a little vegetable oil, garlic, oregano (the dried stuff is fine for long-cooking applications like this), and a couple of canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce to add a touch of smokiness and heat, compensating nicely for the lack of browned beef.\",\"1.  Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

There are few vegetables you find in the supermarket that are as varied as potatoes. They come in myriad shapes and sizes, but don’t let all that variety fool you. When it comes to cooking qualities, potatoes can basically be broken down into three categories: high-starch, medium-starch, and low-starch (also referred to as waxy). While most any potato will technically work in any recipe, the end results can be vastly different. French fries made with red potatoes are creamy and dense in the center, as opposed to the fluffy fries made from russets. Mashed potatoes made with medium-starch Yukon Golds will be buttery, thick, and intense, quite unlike the light, almost-aerated mash you get with russets. Waxy red potatoes will hold their shape in soups and stews even after they’ve been cooked to oblivion, while russets will absorb flavors and eventually fall apart.\",\"1.  Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot over high heat.

Separate the skin from the breasts (see here).\",\"3.  Heat 8 tablespoons of the butter in a small skillet or microwave until just melted (it should bubble). Transfer to a small bowl. Whisk in the parsley, thyme, sage, rosemary, garlic, and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Rub this mixture evenly all over the bird and under the skin (it will harden and clump a bit as it hits the cold bird). Place the turkey on a V-rack.\",\"4.  If desired, stuff the turkey. Line the cavity with a double layer of cheesecloth. Fill with the stuffing, then use twine to tie the cheesecloth into a sack. Remove the sack and place on a plate. Microwave on high power until the center of the stuffing registers at least 180°F, about 10 minutes. Carefully return the stuffing to the turkey cavity. Stuff the cavity at the turkey neck with the reserved stuffing.\",\"5.  Remove the roasting pan from the oven, transfer the V-rack to the roasting pan, and immediately place it on the hot steel or stone, with the legs of the turkey facing the rear. Reduce the oven temperature to 300°F and roast until the turkey is golden brown, the deepest part of the breast registers 150°F on an instant-read thermometer, and the legs register at least 165°F, about 3 to 4 hours, spooning the browned butter from the roasting pan over the turkey every hour or so.\",\"6.  While the turkey is roasting, chop the neck into 1-inch chunks with a cleaver. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until smoking. Add the turkey neck, onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 10 minutes. Add the stock, bay leaves, soy sauce, and Marmite and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and simmer for 1 hour.\",\"7.  Strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer into a large glass measure. You should have a little over 4 cups; if not, add more stock or water. Discard the solids and set the stock aside.\",\"8.  When the turkey is cooked, transfer the V-rack to a rimmed baking sheet. Pour the hot melted butter from the bottom of the roasting pan over the turkey. Tent with foil and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes before carving.

When will it all end?!?\",\"1.  Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 400°F. Split the potatoes in half lengthwise. Place one half cut side down on the cutting board and slice into planks ⅓ to ½ inch thick. Repeat with the remaining potato halves.\",\"2.  Place the potatoes and vinegar in a medium saucepan, add 2 quarts water and 2 tablespoons salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil until the potatoes are fully tender but not falling apart, about 10 minutes. Drain, then transfer them to a medium bowl, add the buttermilk, and toss gently to combine (it’s OK if some potatoes break). Allow to sit for 5 minutes.\",\"3.  Meanwhile, add the oil to a rimmed baking sheet and place it in the oven to preheat. Combine the garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and 1 tablespoon salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.\",\"4.  Drain the potatoes and return them to the bowl. Sprinkle half the flour mixture over them and turn a few times. Sprinkle the remaining flour mixture over them and fold gently until all the potatoes are coated. Let them sit in the flour mixture for at least 5 minutes, tossing occasionally, until a thick layer of coating has built up around each plank.\",\"5.  Working in batches, transfer the potatoes to a fine-mesh strainer and shake gently over the sink to remove the excess flour, then transfer to a large bowl.\",\"6.  Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven (the oil should be lightly smoking) and add the potato planks in a single layer. Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake until the bottom side of the potatoes is light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and flip the potatoes using a thin flexible spatula. Return to the oven and continue to bake until both sides are deep golden brown and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Drain on paper towels, season with salt to taste, and serve immediately.\"]",
